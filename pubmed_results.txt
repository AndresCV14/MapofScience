TI  - Research Tools for the Functional Genomics of Plant miRNAs During Zygotic and 
      Somatic Embryogenesis.
LID - 10.3390/ijms21144969 [doi]
LID - 4969
AB  - During early plant embryogenesis, some of the most fundamental decisions on fate and 
      identity are taken making it a fascinating process to study. It is no surprise that 
      higher plant embryogenesis was intensively analysed during the last century, while 
      somatic embryogenesis is probably the most studied regeneration model. Encoded by 
      the MIRNA, short, single-stranded, non-coding miRNAs, are commonly present in all 
      Eukaryotic genomes and are involved in the regulation of the gene expression during 
      the essential developmental processes such as plant morphogenesis, hormone 
      signaling, and developmental phase transition. During the last few years dedicated 
      to miRNAs, analytical methods and tools have been developed, which have afforded new 
      opportunities in functional analyses of plant miRNAs, including (i) databases for in 
      silico analysis; (ii) miRNAs detection and expression approaches; (iii) reporter and 
      sensor lines for a spatio-temporal analysis of the miRNA-target interactions; (iv) 
      in situ hybridisation protocols; (v) artificial miRNAs; (vi) MIM and STTM lines to 
      inhibit miRNA activity, and (vii) the target genes resistant to miRNA. Here, we 
      attempted to summarise the toolbox for functional analysis of miRNAs during plant 
      embryogenesis. In addition to characterising the described tools/methods, examples 
      of the applications have been presented.

TI  - Somatic Embryogenesis and Plant Regeneration in Viola canescens Wall. Ex. Roxb.: An 
      Endangered Himalayan Herb.
LID - 10.3390/plants10040761 [doi]
LID - 761
AB  - Viola canescens Wall. ex. Roxb. is an important but threatened medicinal herb found 
      at 1500-2400 m above mean sea level in the Himalayas. Overexploitation and habitat 
      preference have put the plant under serious threat. Thus, the present study was 
      undertaken to develop an efficient protocol for in vitro propagation via somatic 
      embryogenesis. The results revealed that plant can be regenerated successfully 
      through somatic embryogenesis using leaf derived calli. Regular subculturing of 
      calli on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium with 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid 
      (2,4-D)/indole-3-butyric acid (IBA)/kinetin (Kn) and varying combinations of 
      2,4-D+Kn induced somatic embryogenesis. The maximum average number of somatic 
      embryos (SE) (19.15 ± 2.66) was induced on the medium with 0.15 + 0.05 mg L(-1) of 
      2,4-D and Kn, respectively, and this medium was used as a control. To enhance 
      somatic embryo induction, the control MS medium was supplemented with l-glutamine 
      (200-400 mg L(-1)) and casein hydrolysate (1-4%). The maximum average number of SE 
      (27.66 ± 2.67) and average mature SE (13.16 ± 3.48) were recorded on the medium 
      having 2 % l-glutamine and 50 mg L(-1) casein hydrolysate. The induced SE were 
      asynchronous, so, to foster their maturation, the culture medium (free from growth 
      regulators) was supplemented with abscisic acid (ABA) and silver nitrate (AgNO(3)). 
      The maximum average number (35.96 ± 3.68) of mature SE was noticed on MS medium 
      supplemented with 1.5 mg L(-1) ABA. Mature embryos had two well-developed cotyledons 
      and an elongated hypocotyl root axis. The development of SE into plantlets was 
      significant for embryos matured on the medium with AgNO(3) and ABA, with 86.67% and 
      83.33% conversion on the medium with 0.20 mg L(-1) 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP). The 
      plantlets thus produced acclimatized in a growth chamber before being transferred to 
      the field, which showed 89.89% survival. The plants were morphologically similar to 
      the mother plant with successful flowering.

TI  - Somatic Embryogenesis in Olive.
LID - 10.3390/plants10030433 [doi]
LID - 433
AB  - The olive is a fruit tree species economically very important in countries of the 
      Mediterranean basin. Somatic embryogenesis is a powerful in vitro technique with 
      multiple applications in different fields, including breeding programs performed by 
      both classical and innovative procedures. This editorial paper presents a special 
      issue focused on "Somatic embryogenesis in olive". In this manuscript, the 
      conceptual framework of the special issue is established and the contributions are 
      summarized and put into context. Finally, the main bottlenecks limiting the 
      practical applicability of somatic embryogenesis are identified and the future 
      research prospects are discussed.

TI  - Optimized somatic embryogenesis and plant regeneration in elite Argentinian 
      sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) cultivars.

LID - 171
AB  - BACKGROUND: Biotechnological breeding of elite sugarcane cultivars is currently 
      limited because of the difficulty of regenerating plants by tissue culture. Here, we 
      report that commercially elite sugarcane genotypes, which are adapted to Argentinian 
      agro-ecological conditions, are capable of being regenerated via indirect somatic 
      embryogenesis. Leaf rolls of five elite genotypes were cultured following two callus 
      induction protocols using different concentrations of 2,4-D as the growth regulator. 
      Embryogenic calluses were regenerated under light conditions. Regenerated plants 
      were subsequently acclimatized in the greenhouse under two acclimatization 
      procedures before being transplanted to the field. RESULTS: Four of the five 
      genotypes were able to form somatic embryos following the two induction protocols. 
      The variables related to embryogenic callus production were influenced by 
      the interaction between genotype and culture conditions. For plant regeneration, the 
      embryogenic calluses were further cultured on an IBA-supplemented medium, where we 
      observed a high genotype dependence. Calluses from the four cultivars regenerated a 
      good number of plants. With the procedures described here, we obtained more than 90% 
      of well-acclimatized plants both in the greenhouse and in the field. CONCLUSIONS: 
      This protocol provides a simple way to regenerate sugarcane plants through indirect 
      somatic embryogenesis. Also, the results confirm that tissue culture ability is 
      highly genotype-dependent in sugarcane. Our findings suggest that these elite 
      cultivars could be good candidates for biotechnological breeding.

TI  - Somatic Embryogenesis and Plant Regeneration from Sugi (Japanese Cedar, Cryptomeria 
      japonica D. Don, Cupressaceae) Seed Families by Marker Assisted Selection for the 
      Male Sterility Allele ms1.
LID - 10.3390/plants9081029 [doi]
LID - 1029
AB  - One of the possible countermeasures for pollinosis caused by sugi (Cryptomeria 
      japonica), a serious public health problem in Japan, is the use of male sterile 
      plants (MSPs; pollen-free plants). However, the production efficiencies of MSPs 
      raised by conventional methods are extremely poor, time consuming, and resulting in 
      a high seedling cost. Here, we report the development of a novel technique for 
      efficient production of MSPs, which combines marker-assisted selection (MAS) and 
      somatic embryogenesis (SE). SE from four full sib seed families of sugi, carrying 
      the male sterility gene MS1, was initiated using megagametophyte explants that 
      originated from four seed collections taken at one-week intervals during the month 
      of July 2017. Embryogenic cell lines (ECLs) were achieved in all families, with 
      initiation rates varying from 0.6% to 59%. Somatic embryos were produced from 
      genetic marker-selected male sterile ECLs on medium containing maltose, abscisic 
      acid (ABA), polyethylene glycol (PEG), and activated charcoal (AC). Subsequently, 
      high frequencies of germination and plant conversion (≥76%) were obtained on plant 
      growth regulator-free medium. Regenerated plantlets were acclimatized successfully, 
      and the initial growth of male sterile somatic plants was monitored in the field.

AB  - Seeds are essential for human civilization, so understanding the molecular events 
      underpinning seed development and the zygotic embryo it contains is important. In 
      addition, the approach of somatic embryogenesis is a critical propagation and 
      regeneration strategy to increase desirable genotypes, to develop new genetically 
      modified plants to meet agricultural challenges, and at a basic science level, to 
      test gene function. We briefly review some of the transcription factors (TFs) 
      involved in establishing primary and apical meristems during zygotic embryogenesis, 
      as well as TFs necessary and/or sufficient to drive somatic embryo programs. We 
      focus on the model plant Arabidopsis for which many tools are available, and review 
      as well as speculate about comparisons and contrasts between zygotic and somatic 
      embryo processes.

AB  - Somatic embryogenesis is a method of asexual reproduction that can occur naturally 
      in various plant species and is widely used for clonal propagation, transformation 
      and regeneration of different crops. Somatic embryogenesis shares some developmental 
      and physiological similarities with zygotic embryogenesis as it involves common 
      actors of hormonal, transcriptional, developmental and epigenetic controls. Here, we 
      provide an overview of the main signaling pathways involved in the induction and 
      regulation of somatic embryogenesis with a focus on the master regulators of seed 
      development, LEAFY COTYLEDON 1 and 2, ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE 3 and FUSCA 3 
      transcription factors whose precise role during both zygotic and somatic 
      embryogenesis remains to be fully elucidated.

TI  - Transduction of Signals during Somatic Embryogenesis.
LID - 10.3390/plants11020178 [doi]
LID - 178
AB  - Somatic embryogenesis (SE) is an in vitro biological process in which bipolar 
      structures (somatic embryos) can be induced to form from somatic cells and 
      regenerate into whole plants. Acquisition of the embryogenic potential in culture is 
      initiated when some competent cells within the explants respond to inductive signals 
      (mostly plant growth regulators, PRGs), and de-differentiate into embryogenic cells. 
      Such cells, "canalized" into the embryogenic developmental pathway, are able to 
      generate embryos comparable in structure and physiology to their in vivo 
      counterparts. Genomic and transcriptomic studies have identified several pathways 
      governing the initial stages of the embryogenic process. In this review, the authors 
      emphasize the importance of the developmental signals required for the progression 
      of embryo development, starting with the de-differentiation of somatic cells and 
      culminating with tissue patterning during the formation of the embryo body. The 
      action and interaction of PGRs are highlighted, along with the participation of 
      master regulators, mostly transcription factors (TFs), and proteins involved in 
      stress responses and the signal transduction required for the initiation of the 
      embryogenic process.

TI  - Somatic embryogenesis in Larix: the state of art and perspectives.
PG  - 575-588
LID - 10.18699/VJ20.651 [doi]
AB  - Clonal propagation of conifers using somatic embryogenesis is essential for the 
      selection of tree species, and for the implementation of afforestation and 
      reforestation. In combination with cryopreservation, somatic embryogenesis creates 
      the basis for the development of economically valuable lines of clones and elite 
      genotypes. The industrial use of such genetically verified clone lines in forestry 
      can significantly increase forest productivity compared to any conventional methods 
      for improving tree crops that are available. Larch is considered as one of the main 
      conifer candidates for large-scale reforestation, not only due to the vastness of 
      its habitat, but also due to the unique quality of its wood, rapid growth and high 
      ecological plasticity. However, the vast majority of larch species are characterized 
      by uneven yields and extremely low seed quality. In this regard, obtaining planting 
      material for reforestation from larch seeds on seed plantations is not advisable, 
      but can be successfully implemented in afforestation programs using somatic 
      embryogenesis technologies. Research on the somatic embryogenesis of larch has been 
      conducted for over 30 years, which allowed considerable experience in this field to 
      be accumulated. To date, the conditions for the initiation and maintenance of 
      embryogenic cultures, as well as for the formation and development of somatic 
      embryos have been determined. Significant progress has been made in the study of 
      both the factors affecting these processes and the molecular mechanisms that 
      underlie the various stages of embryogenesis. Nevertheless, despite the successes 
      achieved, knowledge available today on the somatic embryogenesis of representatives 
      of the genus Larix is still not enough to develop technologies for producing 
      valuable plant-breeding material in vitro. This review analyzes the current state of 
      research on the problem of somatic embryogenesis of representatives of the genus 
      Larix. Particular attention is paid to the choice of explants for somatic 
      embryogenesis, the composition of the media for cultivation, the dependence of the 
      potential of somatic embryogenesis on the duration of cultivation, and the genetic 
      control of somatic embryogenesis.

TI  - Secondary Somatic Embryogenesis in Centaurium erythraea Rafn.
LID - 10.3390/plants10020199 [doi]
LID - 199
AB  - Somatic embryogenesis (SE) is a developmental process during which plant somatic 
      cells, under suitable conditions, produce embryogenic cells that develop into 
      somatic embryos (se). SE is the most important method for plant propagation in 
      vitro, having both fundamental and applicative significance. SE can be induced from 
      different tissues and organs, but when se are used as explants, the process is 
      recognized as secondary or cyclic SE. We induced secondary SE in Centaurium 
      erythraea by application of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and 
      N-(2-chloro-4-pyridyl)-N'-phenylurea (CPPU). A medium containing 0.1 mgL(-1) 2,4-D 
      and 0.25 mgL(-1) CPPU was optimal in terms of the number of primary SE explants 
      forming se, the number of well-developed se per explant, and morphological 
      appearance of the obtained se. These concentrations allowed SE to progress through 
      three cycles, whereas at higher concentrations of 0.2 mgL(-1) 2,4-D and 0.5 mgL(-1) 
      CPPU, only two cycles were achieved. Histological analysis revealed that secondary 
      se are formed both directly and indirectly. Secondary SE readily germinated and 
      converted into plantlets. Induction of cyclic SE contributes to the conservation 
      efforts of this endangered medicinal plant and expands the spectrum of in vitro 
      developmental pathways described in centaury-an emerging model in developmental 
      biology.

TI  - Small molecule inhibitors of mammalian GSK-3β promote in vitro plant cell 
      reprogramming and somatic embryogenesis in crop and forest species.
PG  - 7808-7825
LID - 10.1093/jxb/erab365 [doi]
AB  - Plant in vitro regeneration systems, such as somatic embryogenesis, are essential in 
      breeding; they permit propagation of elite genotypes, production of 
      doubled-haploids, and regeneration of whole plants from gene editing or 
      transformation events. However, in many crop and forest species, somatic 
      embryogenesis is highly inefficient. We report a new strategy to improve in vitro 
      embryogenesis using synthetic small molecule inhibitors of mammalian glycogen 
      synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β), never used in plants. These inhibitors increased in 
      vitro embryo production in three different systems and species, microspore 
      embryogenesis of Brassica napus and Hordeum vulgare, and somatic embryogenesis of 
      Quercus suber. TDZD-8, a representative compound of the molecules tested, inhibited 
      GSK-3 activity in microspore cultures, and increased expression of embryogenesis 
      genes FUS3, LEC2, and AGL15. Plant GSK-3 kinase BIN2 is a master regulator of 
      brassinosteroid (BR) signalling. During microspore embryogenesis, BR biosynthesis 
      and signalling genes CPD, GSK-3-BIN2, BES1, and BZR1 were up-regulated and the BAS1 
      catabolic gene was repressed, indicating activation of the BR pathway. TDZD-8 
      increased expression of BR signalling elements, mimicking BR effects. The findings 
      support that the small molecule inhibitors promoted somatic embryogenesis by 
      activating the BR pathway, opening up the way for new strategies using GSK-3β 
      inhibitors that could be extended to other species.

TI  - Indirect somatic embryogenesis of purple coneflower (Echinacea purpurea (L.) 
      Moench): a medicinal-ornamental plant: evaluation of antioxidant enzymes activity 
      and histological study.

AB  - Purple coneflower (Echinacea purpurea (L.) Moench) is a widely used medicinal and 
      ornamental plant. In the present study, the callus embryogenesis was examined using 
      benzyl adenine (BA) at three levels (3, 4, 5 mg L(-1)), 1-Naphthalene acetic acid 
      (NAA) at three levels (0.1, 0.2 and 0.5 mg L(-1)) with or without activated charcoal 
      (1 g L(-1)), coconut milk (50 ml L(-1)) and casein hydrolysate (50 mg L(-1)) in the 
      MS (Murashige and Skoog 1962) medium. The embryogenesis indirectly occurred with the 
      production of callus. The calli were observed in three forms: undifferentiated, 
      embryogenic and organogenic. The embryogenic calli were dark green and coherent with 
      a faster growth rate. The highest embryogenesis (100%) and embryonic regeneration 
      (plantlet production) were obtained in the combined BA + NAA treatments with the 
      activated charcoal, coconut milk and casein hydrolysate. However, the combined 
      treatments of growth regulators failed to produce somatic embryos without the use of 
      coconut milk and casein hydrolysate. The maximum amount of protein, peroxidase and 
      catalase activity of embryogenic calli (2.02, 1.79 and 6.62ΔOD/Min/mg.protein, 
      respectively), and highest percentage of acclimatization success (29.3% of plants) 
      were obtained in the combined treatment of 5 mg L(-1) BA + 0.5 mg L(-1) 
      NAA + activated charcoal + coconut milk + casein hydrolysate. The highest amount of 
      chlorophyll content (33.3 SPAD value) and growth characteristics of acclimatized 
      plantlets were observed in the media containing 3 mg L(-1) BA + 0.1 and 0.2 mg L(-1) 
      NAA + 1 g. L(-1) combined activated charcoal, coconut milk, casein hydrolysate. The 
      histological studies confirmed the somatic embryogenesis in purple coneflower. 
      Generally, it was found that the somatic embryogenesis of E. purpurea occurs at high 
      levels of BA and low levels of NAA with the addition of coconut milk and casein 
      hydrolysate.

PG  - 353-359
LID - 10.1016/j.sjbs.2020.10.013 [doi]
AB  - Bacopa monnieri (Linn.) Wettst. commonly known as waterhyssop, Brahmi plant, 
      traditionally used for memory enhancement, nerve tonic, epilepsy, central nervous 
      system (CNS), antidepressant, anxiety, blood pressure and antioxidant activities. 
      Due to pharmaceutical demands its lost natural habitat. At this juncture we describe 
      a resourceful protocol for micropropagation of water hyssop plant. Surface 
      sterilized leaf and nodal explants were inoculated on basal MS semi-solid medium 
      added with PGRs; auxins, cytokinins. Highest calli formation from leaf explants was 
      obtained on NAA (2.5 mg(-1)) and showed (94.22%) accompanied via 2,4-D showed 
      (2.5 mg(-1); 82.43%), maximum calli formation in nodal explants was obtained on 
      2,4-D showed (2.5 mg(-1); 71.14%) followed by NAA (2.5 mg(-1)) showed (62.15%), in 
      internodes explants uppermost calli formation was obtained from 2,4-D showed 
      (2.5 mg(-1); 65.21%) followed by NAA (2.5 mg(-1)) showed (52.14%). The maximum 
      somatic embryogenic callus, calli induction and formation (84%) was observed on 
      2,4-D + KIN (2.0 + 1.5 mg(-1)) amended solid medium. Uppermost shoot formation was 
      observed in combination of IAA + BAP (1.0 + 1.0 mg(-1)) showed (78.54%) shoot 
      formation followed by IBA (2.0 mg(-1)) alone showed (75.37%). The maximum shoot 
      elongation was noticed from NAA + BAP (3.0 + 3.0 mg(-1)) with 21.21 cm followed by 
      NAA (2.0 mg(-1)) showed (15.22 cm) although, chief root formation was obtained from 
      IBA (2.0 mg(-1)) with 83.75% root formation along higher number of roots (47.43%) 
      per shoot. Followed by IAA (2.0 mg(-1)) showed root induction (73.43%) and no of 
      roots (38.54%) per shoot. In hardening under pot condition plants survivability 
      (100%) was observed under glass house conditions, the present in vitro PTC 
      techniques is extremely significant to gratifying its natural conservation.

TI  - Suspensor-derived somatic embryogenesis in Arabidopsis.
LID - dev188912 [pii]
LID - 10.1242/dev.188912 [doi]
AB  - In many flowering plants, asymmetric division of the zygote generates apical and 
      basal cells with different fates. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the apical cell generates 
      the embryo while the basal cell divides anticlinally, leading to a suspensor of six 
      to nine cells that remain extra-embryonic and eventually senesce. In some genetic 
      backgrounds, or upon ablation of the embryo, suspensor cells can undergo periclinal 
      cell divisions and eventually form a second twin embryo. Likewise, embryogenesis can 
      be induced from somatic cells by various genes, but the relationship with 
      suspensor-derived embryos is unclear. Here, we addressed the nature of the suspensor 
      to embryo fate transformation and its genetic triggers. We expressed most known 
      embryogenesis-inducing genes specifically in suspensor cells. We next analyzed 
      morphology and fate-marker expression in embryos in which suspensor division was 
      activated by different triggers to address the developmental paths towards 
      reprogramming. Our results show that reprogramming of Arabidopsis suspensor cells 
      towards embryonic identity is a specific cellular response that is triggered by 
      defined regulators, follows a conserved developmental trajectory and shares 
      similarity to the process of somatic embryogenesis from post-embryonic tissues.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Optimizing the somatic embryogenesis protocol can be considered as the 
      first and foremost step in successful gene transformation studies. However, it is 
      usually difficult to achieve an optimized embryogenesis protocol due to the cost and 
      time-consuming as well as the complexity of this process. Therefore, it is necessary 
      to use a novel computational approach, such as machine learning algorithms for this 
      aim. In the present study, two machine learning algorithms, including Multilayer 
      Perceptron (MLP) as an artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector regression 
      (SVR), were employed to model somatic embryogenesis of chrysanthemum, as a case 
      study, and compare their prediction accuracy. RESULTS: The results showed that SVR 
      (R(2) > 0.92) had better performance accuracy than MLP (R(2) > 0.82). Moreover, the 
      Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) was also applied for the 
      optimization of the somatic embryogenesis and the results showed that the highest 
      embryogenesis rate (99.09%) and the maximum number of somatic embryos per explant 
      (56.24) can be obtained from a medium containing 9.10 μM 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic 
      acid (2,4-D), 4.70 μM kinetin (KIN), and 18.73 μM sodium nitroprusside (SNP). 
      According to our results, SVR-NSGA-II was able to optimize the chrysanthemum's 
      somatic embryogenesis accurately. CONCLUSIONS: SVR-NSGA-II can be employed as a 
      reliable and applicable computational methodology in future plant tissue culture 
      studies.

TI  - Somatic Embryogenesis in Centaurium erythraea Rafn-Current Status and Perspectives: 
      A Review.
LID - 10.3390/plants10010070 [doi]
LID - 70
AB  - Centaurium erythraea (centaury) is a traditionally used medicinal plant, with a 
      spectrum of secondary metabolites with confirmed healing properties. Centaury is an 
      emerging model in plant developmental biology due to its vigorous regenerative 
      potential and great developmental plasticity when cultured in vitro. Hereby, we 
      review nearly two decades of research on somatic embryogenesis (SE) in centaury. 
      During SE, somatic cells are induced by suitable culture conditions to express their 
      totipotency, acquire embryogenic characteristics, and eventually give rise to 
      somatic embryos. When SE is initiated from centaury root explants, the process 
      occurs spontaneously (on hormone-free medium), directly (without the callusing 
      phase), and the somatic embryos are of unicellular origin. SE from leaf explants has 
      to be induced by plant growth regulators and is indirect (preceded by callusing). 
      Histological observations and culture conditions are compared in these two systems. 
      The changes in antioxidative enzymes were followed during SE from the leaf explants. 
      Special focus is given to the role of arabinogalactan proteins during SE, which were 
      analyzed using a variety of approaches. The newest and preliminary results, 
      including centaury transcriptome, novel potential SE markers, and novel types of 
      arabinogalactan proteins, are discussed as perspectives of centaury research.

TI  - Modulation of Organogenesis and Somatic Embryogenesis by Ethylene: An Overview.
LID - 10.3390/plants10061208 [doi]
LID - 1208
AB  - Ethylene is a plant hormone controlling physiological and developmental processes 
      such as fruit maturation, hairy root formation, and leaf abscission. Its effect on 
      regeneration systems, such as organogenesis and somatic embryogenesis (SE), has been 
      studied, and progress in molecular biology techniques have contributed to unveiling 
      the mechanisms behind its effects. The influence of ethylene on regeneration should 
      not be overlooked. This compound affects regeneration differently, depending on the 
      species, genotype, and explant. In some species, ethylene seems to revert 
      recalcitrance in genotypes with low regeneration capacity. However, its effect is 
      not additive, since in genotypes with high regeneration capacity this ability 
      decreases in the presence of ethylene precursors, suggesting that regeneration is 
      modulated by ethylene. Several lines of evidence have shown that the role of 
      ethylene in regeneration is markedly connected to biotic and abiotic stresses as 
      well as to hormonal-crosstalk, in particular with key regeneration hormones and 
      growth regulators of the auxin and cytokinin families. Transcriptional factors of 
      the ethylene response factor (ERF) family are regulated by ethylene and strongly 
      connected to SE induction. Thus, an evident connection between ethylene, stress 
      responses, and regeneration capacity is markedly established. In this review the 
      effect of ethylene and the way it interacts with other players during organogenesis 
      and somatic embryogenesis is discussed. Further studies on the regulation of ERF 
      gene expression induced by ethylene during regeneration can contribute to new 
      insights on the exact role of ethylene in these processes. A possible role in 
      epigenetic modifications should be considered, since some ethylene signaling 
      components are directly related to histone acetylation.

AB  - Plant somatic embryogenesis refers to a phenomenon where embryos develop from 
      somatic cells in the absence of fertilization. Previous studies have revealed that 
      the phytohormone auxin plays a crucial role in somatic embryogenesis by inducing a 
      cell totipotent state, although its underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Here, 
      we show that auxin rapidly rewires the cell totipotency network by altering 
      chromatin accessibility. The analysis of chromatin accessibility dynamics further 
      reveals a hierarchical gene regulatory network underlying somatic embryogenesis. 
      Particularly, we find that the embryonic nature of explants is a prerequisite for 
      somatic cell reprogramming. Upon cell reprogramming, the B3-type totipotent 
      transcription factor LEC2 promotes somatic embryo formation by direct activation of 
      the early embryonic patterning genes WOX2 and WOX3. Our results thus shed light on 
      the molecular mechanism by which auxin promotes the acquisition of plant cell 
      totipotency and establish a direct link between cell totipotent genes and the 
      embryonic development pathway.

TI  - Effect of Cryopreservation on Olive (Olea europaea L.) Plant Regeneration via 
      Somatic Embryogenesis.
LID - 10.3390/plants10010034 [doi]
LID - 34
AB  - Olive somatic embryos have been successfully cryopreserved using the 
      droplet-vitrification method on aluminum foil strips. Although acceptable recovery 
      rates have been obtained after rewarming, the influence of this cryopreservation 
      protocol on the somatic embryogenesis process is unknown. To evaluate the effect of 
      cryopreservation on olive somatic embryogenesis, the behavior of cultures 
      established from cryopreserved somatic embryos was compared with that of control, 
      non-cryopreserved cultures in the different phases of the somatic embryogenesis 
      process. In order to analyze the influence of the genotype, this investigation was 
      carried out in two independent lines. During the proliferation step, only the line 
      T1 was affected by cryopreservation, with higher fresh weight increases. Although 
      similar total embryos were produced per culture, freezing in liquid nitrogen 
      significantly improved the maturation pattern in the line P5. Better germination 
      results were also found in this embryogenic line. The genotype plays a key role, 
      largely determining the effect of cryopreservation on olive somatic embryogenesis. A 
      specific genotype-dependent response was found depending on the culture step. 
      Variations observed could not be associated to differences in the embryogenic lines' 
      instability to maintain their morphogenic competence after cryopreservation. 
      Embryogenic cultures established after rewarming retained their regeneration 
      capacity, with no evident negative effects affecting their regeneration capacity.

TI  - Priming Maritime Pine Megagametophytes during Somatic Embryogenesis Improved Plant 
      Adaptation to Heat Stress.
LID - 10.3390/plants10030446 [doi]
LID - 446
AB  - In the context of global climate change, forest tree research should be addressed to 
      provide genotypes with increased resilience to high temperature events. These 
      improved plants can be obtained by heat priming during somatic embryogenesis (SE), 
      which would produce an epigenetic-mediated transgenerational memory. Thereby, we 
      applied 37 °C or 50 °C to maritime pine (Pinus pinaster) megagametophytes and the 
      obtained embryogenic masses went through the subsequent SE phases to produce plants 
      that were further subjected to heat stress conditions. A putative transcription 
      factor WRKY11 was upregulated in priming-derived embryonal masses, and also in the 
      regenerated P37 and P50 plants, suggesting its role in establishing an epigenetic 
      memory in this plant species. In vitro-grown P50 plants also showed higher cytokinin 
      content and SOD upregulation, which points to a better responsiveness to heat 
      stress. Heat exposure of two-year-old maritime pine plants induced upregulation of 
      HSP70 in those derived from primed embryogenic masses, that also showed better 
      osmotic adjustment and higher increases in chlorophyll, soluble sugars and starch 
      contents. Moreover, ϕPSII of P50 plants was less affected by heat exposure. Thus, 
      our results suggest that priming at 50 °C at the SE induction phase is a promising 
      strategy to improve heat resilience in maritime pine.

LID - 31
AB  - BACKGROUND: Somatic embryogenesis (SE) is an intricate molecular and biochemical 
      process principally based on cellular totipotency and a model in studying plant 
      development. In this unique embryo-forming process, the vegetative cells acquire 
      embryogenic competence under cellular stress conditions. The stress caused by plant 
      growth regulators (PGRs), nutrient, oxygenic, or other signaling elements makes 
      cellular reprogramming and transforms vegetative cells into embryos through 
      activation/deactivation of a myriad of genes and transcriptional networks. Hundreds 
      of genes have been directly linked to zygotic and somatic embryogeneses; some of 
      them like SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS LIKE RECEPTOR KINASE (SERK), LEAFY COTYLEDON (LEC), 
      BABYBOOM (BBM), and AGAMOUS-LIKE 15 (AGL15) are very important and are part of 
      molecular network. MAIN TEXT (OBSERVATION): This article reviews various 
      genes/orthologs isolated from different plants; encoded proteins and their possible 
      role in regulating somatic embryogenesis of plants have been discussed. The role of 
      SERK in regulating embryogenesis is also summarized. Different SE-related proteins 
      identified through LC-MS at various stages of embryogenesis are also described; a 
      few proteins like 14-3-3, chitinase, and LEA are used as potential SE markers. These 
      networks are interconnected in a complicated manner, posing challenges for their 
      complete elucidation. CONCLUSIONS: The various gene networks and factors controlling 
      somatic embryogenesis have been discussed and presented. The roles of stress, PGRs, 
      and other signaling elements have been discussed. In the last two-to-three decades' 
      progress, the challenges ahead and its future applications in various fields of 
      research have been highlighted. The review also presents the need of high 
      throughput, innovative techniques, and sensitive instruments in unraveling the 
      mystery of SE.

AB  - Potentially embryogenic oil palms can be identified through leaf transcriptomic 
      signatures. Differential expression of genes involved in flowering time, and stress 
      and light responses may associate with somatic embryogenesis potential. Clonal 
      propagation is an attractive approach for the mass propagation of high yielding oil 
      palms. A major issue hampering the effectiveness of oil palm tissue culture is the 
      low somatic embryogenesis rate. Previous studies have identified numerous genes 
      involved in oil palm somatic embryogenesis, but their association with embryogenic 
      potential has not been determined. In this study, differential expression analysis 
      of leaf transcriptomes from embryogenic and non-embryogenic mother palms revealed 
      that transcriptome profiles from non- and poor embryogenic mother palms were more 
      similar than highly embryogenic palms. A total of 171 genes exhibiting differential 
      expression in non- and low embryogenesis groups could also discriminate high from 
      poor embryogenesis groups of another tissue culture agency. Genes related to 
      flowering time or transition such as FTIP, FRIGIDA-LIKE, and NF-YA were up-regulated 
      in embryogenic ortets, suggesting that reproduction timing of the plant may 
      associate with somatic embryogenesis potential. Several light response or 
      photosynthesis-related genes were down-regulated in embryogenic ortets, suggesting a 
      link between photosynthesis activity and embryogenic potential. As expression 
      profiles of the differentially expressed genes are very similar between non- and low 
      embryogenic groups, machine learning approaches with several candidate genes may 
      generate a more sensitive model to better discriminate non-embryogenic from 
      embryogenic ortets.

AB  - This study developed somatic embryogenesis protocols for Picea pungens (Engelm), an 
      important ornamental species, including initiation, proliferation, maturation, 
      germination, and acclimation. Somatic embryogenic tissues were induced from mature 
      zygotic embryos of five families, with a frequency of [Formula: see text] 22% for 
      each. Embryogenic tissues (ET) from 13 clones of three families were proliferated 
      for one week, achieving an average rate of 179.1%. The ET of 38 clones of three 
      families were cultured in maturation medium for six weeks; 188 mature embryos on 
      average were counted per gram ET cultured, of which [Formula: see text] 81.1% 
      appeared normal, and each clone developed at least 28 normally matured embryos. A 
      total of 69.9% or more of cotyledonary somatic embryos germinated normally and 
      developed into normal emblings. The experiment of transplanting the emblings into a 
      greenhouse had an average survival rate of 68.5%. Considerable variation among and 
      within families during initiation and proliferation was observed, but this variation 
      decreased in the maturation and germination. Changing the concentration of plant 
      growth regulator of the initiation medium did not significantly change the 
      initiation frequency. We recommend incorporating these protocols into the current 
      Picea pungens practical programs, although further research is essential to increase 
      efficiencies and reduce cost.

TI  - Epigenetic Regulation of Auxin-Induced Somatic Embryogenesis in Plants.
LID - 10.3390/ijms21072307 [doi]
LID - 2307
AB  - Somatic embryogenesis (SE) that is induced in plant explants in response to auxin 
      treatment is closely associated with an extensive genetic reprogramming of the cell 
      transcriptome. The significant modulation of the gene transcription profiles during 
      SE induction results from the epigenetic factors that fine-tune the gene expression 
      towards embryogenic development. Among these factors, microRNA molecules (miRNAs) 
      contribute to the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. In the past 
      few years, several miRNAs that regulate the SE-involved transcription factors (TFs) 
      have been identified, and most of them were involved in the auxin-related processes, 
      including auxin metabolism and signaling. In addition to miRNAs, chemical 
      modifications of DNA and chromatin, in particular the methylation of DNA and 
      histones and histone acetylation, have been shown to shape the SE transcriptomes. In 
      response to auxin, these epigenetic modifications regulate the chromatin structure, 
      and hence essentially contribute to the control of gene expression during SE 
      induction. In this paper, we describe the current state of knowledge with regard to 
      the SE epigenome. The complex interactions within and between the epigenetic 
      factors, the key SE TFs that have been revealed, and the relationships between the 
      SE epigenome and auxin-related processes such as auxin perception, metabolism, and 
      signaling are highlighted.

TI  - Somatic embryogenesis is an effective strategy for dissecting chimerism phenomena in 
      Vitis vinifera cv Nebbiolo.
PG  - 205-211
LID - 10.1007/s00299-020-02626-9 [doi]
AB  - The tendency of somatic embryogenesis to regenerate plants only from the L1 layer, 
      associated with the spread of chimerism in grapevine, must be carefully considered 
      in the framework of biotechnological improvement programmes. Grapevine is an 
      important fruit crop with a high economic value linked to traditional genotypes that 
      have been multiplied for centuries by vegetative propagation. In this way, somatic 
      variations that can spontaneously occur within the shoot apical meristem are fixed 
      in the whole plant and represent a source of intra-varietal variability. Previously 
      identified inconsistencies in the allelic calls of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) 
      suggested that the Vitis vinifera 'Nebbiolo' CVT185 clone is a potential periclinal 
      chimera. We adopted the somatic embryogenesis technique to separate the two 
      genotypes putatively associated with the L1 and L2 layers of CVT185 into different 
      somaclones. Despite the recalcitrance of 'Nebbiolo' to the embryogenic process, 58 
      somaclones were regenerated and SNV genotyping assays attested that the genotype of 
      all them differed from that of the mother plant and was only attributable to L1. The 
      results confirmed that L2 has low or no competence for differentiating somatic 
      embryos. After one year in the greenhouse, the somaclones showed no phenotypic 
      alterations in comparison with the mother plant; however further analyses are needed 
      to identify potential endogenous sources of variation. The tendency of somatic 
      embryogenesis to regenerate plants only from L1 must be carefully considered in the 
      framework of biotechnological improvement programmes in this species.

AB  - Conifers are the world's major source of timber and pulpwood and have great economic 
      and ecological value. Currently, little research on the application of CRISPR/Cas9, 
      the commonly used genome-editing tool in angiosperms, has been reported in 
      coniferous species. An efficient CRISPR/Cas9 system based on somatic embryogenesis 
      (SEis) suitable for conifers could benefit both fundamental and applied research in 
      these species. In this study, the SpCas9 gene was optimized based on codon bias in 
      white spruce, and a spruce U6 promoter was cloned and function-validated for use in 
      a conifer specific CRISPR/Cas9 toolbox, i.e., PgCas9/PaU6. With this toolbox, a 
      genome-editing vector was constructed to target the DXS1 gene of white spruce. By 
      Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, the genome-editing vector was then 
      transferred into embryogenic tissue of white spruce. Three resistant embryogenic 
      tissues were obtained and used for regenerating plants via SEis. Albino somatic 
      embryo (SE) plants with mutations in DXS1 were obtained in all of the three events, 
      and the ratios of the homozygous and biallelic mutants in the 18 albino mutants 
      detected were 22.2% in both cases. Green plants with mutations in DXS1 were also 
      produced, and the ratios of the DXS1 mutants to the total green plants were 7.9, 28, 
      and 13.5%, respectively, among the three events. Since 22.7% of the total 44 mutants 
      were edited at both of the target sites 1 and 2, the CRISPR/Cas9 toolbox in this 
      research could be used for multi-sites genome editing. More than 2,000 SE plants 
      were regenerated in vitro after genome editing, and part of them showed differences 
      in plant development. Both chimerism and mosaicism were found in the SE plants of 
      white spruce after genome editing with the CRISPR/Cas9 toolbox. The conifer-specific 
      CRISPR/Cas9 system developed in this research could be valuable in gene function 
      research and trait improvement.

AB  - Plant cells have a powerful capacity in their propagation to adapt to environmental 
      change, given that a single plant cell can give rise to a whole plant via somatic 
      embryogenesis without the need for fertilization. The reprogramming of somatic cells 
      into totipotent cells is a critical step in somatic embryogenesis. This process can 
      be induced by stimuli such as plant hormones, transcriptional regulators and stress. 
      Here, we review current knowledge on how the identity of totipotent cells is 
      determined and the stimuli required for reprogramming of somatic cells into 
      totipotent cells. We highlight key molecular regulators and associated networks that 
      control cell fate transition from somatic to totipotent cells. Finally, we pose 
      several outstanding questions that should be addressed to enhance our understanding 
      of the mechanisms underlying plant cell totipotency.

      Plants.

LID - 11807
AB  - Embryogenesis is the primary developmental program in plants. The mechanisms that 
      underlie the regulation of embryogenesis are an essential research subject given its 
      potential contribution to mass in vitro propagation of profitable plant species. 
      Somatic embryogenesis (SE) refers to the use of in vitro techniques to mimic the 
      sexual reproduction program known as zygotic embryogenesis (ZE). In this review, we 
      synthesize the current state of research on proteomic and metabolomic studies of SE 
      and ZE in angiosperms (monocots and dicots) and gymnosperms. The most striking 
      finding was the small number of studies addressing ZE. Meanwhile, the research 
      effort focused on SE has been substantial but disjointed. Together, these research 
      gaps may explain why the embryogenic induction stage and the maturation of the 
      somatic embryo continue to be bottlenecks for efficient and large-scale regeneration 
      of plants. Comprehensive and integrative studies of both SE and ZE are needed to 
      provide the molecular foundation of plant embryogenesis, information which is needed 
      to rationally guide experimental strategies to solve SE drawbacks in each species.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Somatic embryogenesis is a phenomenon carried out in an environment that 
      generates abiotic stress. Thus, regenerants may differ from the source of explants 
      at the morphological, genetic, and epigenetic levels. The DNA changes may be the 
      outcome of induction media ingredients (i.e., copper and silver ions) and their 
      concentrations and time of in vitro cultures. RESULTS: This study optimised the 
      level of copper and silver ion concentration in culture media parallel with the 
      induction medium longevity step towards obtaining barley regenerants via somatic 
      embryogenesis with a minimum or maximum level of tissue culture-induced differences 
      between the donor plant and its regenerants. The optimisation process is based on 
      tissue culture-induced variation evaluated via the metAFLP approach for regenerants 
      derived under varying in vitro tissue culture conditions and exploited by the 
      Taguchi method. In the optimisation and verification experiments, various copper and 
      silver ion concentrations and the different number of days differentiated the tested 
      trials concerning the tissue culture-induced variation level, DNA demethylation, and 
      de novo methylation, including symmetric (CG, CHG) and asymmetric (CHH) DNA sequence 
      contexts. Verification of optimised conditions towards obtaining regenerants with 
      minimum and maximum variability compared to donor plants proved useful. The main 
      changes that discriminate optimised conditions belonged to DNA demethylation events 
      with particular stress on CHG context. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of tissue 
      culture-induced variation evaluated for eight experimental trials and implementation 
      of the Taguchi method allowed the optimisation of the in vitro tissue culture 
      conditions towards the minimum and maximum differences between a source of tissue 
      explants (donor plant) and its regenerants from somatic embryos. The tissue 
      culture-induced variation characteristic is mostly affected by demethylation with 
      preferences towards CHG sequence context.

TI  - WUSCHEL Overexpression Promotes Callogenesis and Somatic Embryogenesis in Medicago 
      truncatula Gaertn.
LID - 10.3390/plants10040715 [doi]
LID - 715
AB  - The induction of plant somatic embryogenesis is often a limiting step for plant 
      multiplication and genetic manipulation in numerous crops. It depends on multiple 
      signaling developmental processes involving phytohormones and the induction of 
      specific genes. The WUSCHEL gene (WUS) is required for the production of plant 
      embryogenic stem cells. To explore a different approach to induce somatic 
      embryogenesis, we have investigated the effect of the heterologous ArabidopsisWUS 
      gene overexpression under the control of the jasmonate responsive vsp1 promoter on 
      the morphogenic responses of Medicago truncatula explants. WUS expression in leaf 
      explants increased callogenesis and embryogenesis in the absence of growth 
      regulators. Similarly, WUS expression enhanced the embryogenic potential of hairy 
      root fragments. The WUS gene represents thus a promising tool to develop plant 
      growth regulator-free regeneration systems or to improve regeneration and 
      transformation efficiency in recalcitrant crops.

TI  - Direct and Indirect Somatic Embryogenesis Induction in Camellia oleifera Abel.
PG  - 644389

LID - 644389
AB  - Camellia oleifera Abel. is an important woody oil species; however, the shortage of 
      rapid and industrialized seedling culture is a large constraint on the development 
      of the tea oil industry. Somatic embryogenesis (SE) is one of the main powerful 
      biotechnological tools for plant mass regeneration, but the largely unknown SE in C. 
      oleifera limits the scale production of clonal plants. In this study, we described a 
      high-efficiency SE system via direct and indirect pathways in C. oleifera and 
      investigated the effect of genotype, explant age and phytohormones on SE. In the 
      direct pathway, somatic embryos were highly induced from immature seeds 220 days 
      after full blossom, and the development of embryoids was achieved with a combination 
      of 0.19 mg/L 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and 0.05 mg/L thidiazuron (TDZ). 
      In the indirect pathway, embryogenic calli were induced from the same explants in 
      medium containing 1.5 mg/L 2,4-D, while 0.75 mg/L 2,4-D treatment led to high 
      proliferation rates for embryogenic calli. The addition of 0.19 mg/L 2,4-D alone 
      stimulated the production of globular embryos while causing a 75% loss of the 
      induction rate in the heart embryo stage. Upon transfer of the globular embryos to 
      phytohormone-free medium, an optimal induction rate of 62.37% from globular embryos 
      to cotyledonary embryos was obtained. These data suggest that the subsequent 
      differentiation process after the globular embryo stage in ISE is more similar to an 
      endogenous phytohormones-driven process. Mature embryos germinated to produce intact 
      plantlets on half-strength MS basal medium with a regeneration rate of 63.67%. 
      Histological analysis confirmed the vascular bundle isolation of embryoids from the 
      mother tissue. We further studied the different varieties and found that there were 
      no significant genotype differences for SE induction efficiency in C. oleifera. 
      Thus, we established a high-efficiency induction system for direct and indirect 
      somatic embryogenesis (ISE) in C. oleifera and regenerated intact plantlets via SE, 
      not organogenesis. ISE has a more complicated induction and regulatory mechanism 
      than direct somatic embryogenesis. The improved protocol of SE would benefit mass 
      propagation and genetic manipulation in C. oleifera.

TI  - Synthetic Strigolactone GR24 Improves Arabidopsis Somatic Embryogenesis through 
      Changes in Auxin Responses.
LID - 10.3390/plants10122720 [doi]
LID - 2720
AB  - Somatic embryogenesis in Arabidopsis encompasses an induction phase requiring auxin 
      as the inductive signal to promote cellular dedifferentiation and formation of the 
      embryogenic tissue, and a developmental phase favoring the maturation of the 
      embryos. Strigolactones (SLs) have been categorized as a novel group of plant 
      hormones based on their ability to affect physiological phenomena in plants. The 
      study analyzed the effects of synthetic strigolactone GR24, applied during the 
      induction phase, on auxin response and formation of somatic embryos. The expression 
      level of two SL biosynthetic genes, MOREAXILLARY GROWTH 3 and 4 (MAX3 and MAX4), 
      which are responsible for the conversion of carotene to carotenal, increased during 
      the induction phase of embryogenesis. Arabidopsis mutant studies indicated that the 
      somatic embryo number was inhibited in max3 and max4 mutants, and this effect was 
      reversed by applications of GR24, a synthetic strigolactone, and exacerbated by 
      TIS108, a SL biosynthetic inhibitor. The transcriptional studies revealed that the 
      regulation of GR24 and TIS108 on somatic embryogenesis correlated with changes in 
      expression of AUXIN RESPONSIVE FACTORs 5, 8, 10, and 16, known to be required for 
      the production of the embryogenic tissue, as well as the expression of WUSCHEL (WUS) 
      and Somatic Embryogenesis Receptor-like Kinase 1 (SERK1), which are markers of cell 
      dedifferentiation and embryogenic tissue formation. Collectively, this work 
      demonstrated the novel role of SL in enhancing the embryogenic process in 
      Arabidopsis and its requirement for inducing the expression of genes related to 
      auxin signaling and production of embryogenic tissue.

AB  - Somatic embryogenesis (SE), which is in vitro regeneration of plant bodies from 
      somatic cells, represents a useful means of clonal propagation and genetic 
      engineering of forest trees. While protocols to obtain calluses and induce 
      regeneration in somatic embryos have been reported for many tree species, the 
      knowledge of molecular mechanisms of SE development is still insufficient to achieve 
      an efficient supply of somatic embryos required for the industrial application. 
      Cryptomeria japonica, a conifer species widely used for plantation forestry in 
      Japan, is one of the tree species waiting for a secure SE protocol; the probability 
      of normal embryo development appears to depend on genotype. To discriminate the 
      embryogenic potential of embryonal masses (EMs) and efficiently obtain normal 
      somatic embryos of C. japonica, we investigated the effects of genotype and 
      transcriptome on the variation in embryogenic potential. Using an induction 
      experiment with 12 EMs each from six genotypes, we showed that embryogenic potential 
      differs between/within genotypes. Comparisons of gene expression profiles among EMs 
      with different embryogenic potentials revealed that 742 differently expressed genes 
      were mainly associated with pattern forming and metabolism. Thus, we suggest that 
      not only genotype but also gene expression profiles can determine success in SE 
      development. Consistent with previous findings for other conifer species, genes 
      encoding leafy cotyledon, wuschel, germin-like proteins, and 
      glutathione-S-transferases are likely to be involved in SE development in C. 
      japonica and indeed highly expressed in EMs with high-embryogenic potential; 
      therefore, these proteins represent candidate markers for distinguishing embryogenic 
      potential.

TI  - Indirect Somatic Embryogenesis and Cryopreservation of Agave tequilana Weber 
      Cultivar 'Chato'.
LID - 10.3390/plants10020249 [doi]
LID - 249
AB  - Agave tequilana Weber cultivar 'Chato' represents an important genetic supply of 
      wild severely in decline populations of 'Chato' for breeding and transformation 
      programs. In this work, the indirect somatic embryogenesis and cryopreservation of 
      Somatic Embryos (SEs) were investigated using the 'Chato' cultivar as a study case. 
      METHODS: Embryogenic calli were induced by the cultivation of 1 cm of young leaves 
      from in vitro plants on MS semisolid medium supplemented with 24.84, 33.13, 41.41, 
      49.69, and 57.98 μM 4-amino-3,5,6-trichloro-2- pyridinecarboxylic acid (picloram) in 
      combination with 2.21, 3.32, and 4.43 μM 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP). The origin and 
      structure of formed SEs were verified by histological analysis. Cryopreservation 
      studies of SEs were performed following the V-cryoplate technique and using for 
      dehydration two vitrification solutions (PVS2 and PVS3). RESULTS: The highest 
      average (52.43 ± 5.74) of produced SEs and the Embryo Forming Capacity (estimated 
      index 52.43) were obtained using 49.69 µM picloram and 3.32 µM BAP in the culture 
      medium. The highest post-cryopreservation regrowth (83%) and plant conversion rate 
      (around 70%) were achieved with PVS2 at 0 °C for 15 min. CONCLUSION: Our work 
      provides new advances about somatic embryogenesis in Agave and reports the first 
      results on cryopreservation of SEs of this species.

      somatic embryogenesis.

AB  - Somatic embryogenesis is a type of plant cell totipotency where embryos develop from 
      nonreproductive (vegetative) cells without fertilization. Somatic embryogenesis can 
      be induced in vitro by auxins, and by ectopic expression of embryo-expressed 
      transcription factors like the BABY BOOM (BBM) AINTEGUMENTA-LIKE APETALA2/ETHYLENE 
      RESPONSE FACTOR domain protein. These different pathways are thought to converge to 
      promote auxin response and biosynthesis, but the specific roles of the endogenous 
      auxin pathway in somatic embryogenesis induction have not been well-characterized. 
      Here we show that BBM transcriptionally regulates the YUCCA3 (YUC3) and YUC8 auxin 
      biosynthesis genes during BBM-mediated somatic embryogenesis in Arabidopsis 
      (Arabidopsis thaliana) seedlings. BBM induced local and ectopic YUC3 and YUC8 
      expression in seedlings, which coincided with increased DR5 auxin response and 
      indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) biosynthesis and with ectopic expression of the WOX2 
      embryo reporter. YUC-driven auxin biosynthesis was required for BBM-mediated somatic 
      embryogenesis, as the number of embryogenic explants was reduced by ca. 50% in yuc3 
      yuc8 mutants and abolished after chemical inhibition of YUC enzyme activity. 
      However, a detailed YUC inhibitor time-course study revealed that YUC-dependent IAA 
      biosynthesis is not required for the re-initiation of totipotent cell identity in 
      seedlings. Rather, YUC enzymes are required later in somatic embryo development for 
      the maintenance of embryo identity and growth. This study resolves a long-standing 
      question about the role of endogenous auxin biosynthesis in transcription 
      factor-mediated somatic embryogenesis and also provides an experimental framework 
      for understanding the role of endogenous auxin biosynthesis in other in planta and 
      in vitro embryogenesis systems.

AB  - A new and simple protocol has been developed and standardized for direct somatic 
      embryogenesis and plant regeneration from aseptic seedlings derived from immature 
      Brassica juncea seeds. Depending on the age of immature seeds and nutrient media, in 
      vitro occurrence of embryogenesis and the number of embryos from each seedling have 
      varied greatly. The largest number of somatic embryos, producing 12.7 embryos per 
      seedlings, have been developed by seedlings obtained from immature seeds collected 
      after 21 days of pollination (DAP). Effect of different nutrient media [Gamborg 
      (B5), Murashige and Skoog (MS) and Linsmaier and Skoog (SH)] and carbon sources 
      (fructose, glucose, maltose and sucrose) were assessed to induce somatic embryos and 
      the maximum response were achieved on Nitsch culture medium fortified with sucrose 
      (3% w/v) followed by fructose and maltose. The somatic embryo converted into 
      complete plantlets within 04-weeks of culture on Nitsch medium containing 
      half-strength of micro and macro salts. The regenerated plantlets were successfully 
      established in soil with 90% survival rate. The acclimated plants were subsequently 
      transferred to field condition where they grew normally without any phenotypic 
      differences. Genetic stability of B. juncea plants regenerated from somatic embryos 
      were confirmed by inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR)-PCR analysis and flow 
      cytometry. No significant difference in ploidy level and ISSR banding pattern were 
      documented between somatic embryo's plants and control plants grown ex vitro.

AB  - Plant somatic embryogenesis receptor-like kinases (SERK), members of leucine-rich 
      repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs) subfamily, are widely involved in plant 
      growth, development and innate immunity. In this study, the setaria italica somatic 
      embryogenesis receptor-like kinase1 gene (SiSERK1) was cloned by gateway technology, 
      and transferred into a brasssinosteroid (BR) receptor mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana 
      WS2 (bri1-5). After BL treatment, the transgenic plants could partially restore the 
      phenotype of bri1-5. After Pst DC3000 treatment, the CFU value of SiSERK1 
      overexpression plant pathogen was between WS2 and bri1-5. Stomatal opening and plant 
      height were also between them. Therefore, it is speculated that SiSERK1 gene is 
      involved in BR signaling pathway and can improve the resistance of bri1-5 to Pst 
      DC3000 through SA and NHP mediated systemic acquired resistance (SAR).

TI  - Cloning Coconut via Somatic Embryogenesis: A Review of the Current Status and Future 
      Prospects.
LID - 10.3390/plants10102050 [doi]
LID - 2050
AB  - Coconut [Cocos&nbsp;nucifera L.] is often called "the tree of life" because of its 
      many uses in the food, beverage, medicinal, and cosmetic industries. Currently, more 
      than 50% of the palms grown throughout the world are senile and need to be replanted 
      immediately to ensure production levels meet the present and increasing demand for 
      coconut products. Mass replanting will not be possible using traditional propagation 
      methods from seed. Recent studies have indicated that in vitro cloning via somatic 
      embryogenesis is the most promising alternative for the large-scale production of 
      new coconut palms. This paper provides a review on the status and prospects for the 
      application of somatic embryogenesis to mass clonal propagation of coconut.

AB  - Zygotic and somatic embryogenesis in plants is a fascinating event that is finely 
      regulated through the expression of a specific group of genes and dynamic levels of 
      plant hormones whose concerted action determines the fate that specific cells follow 
      towards zygotic or somatic embryo development. This work studied different stages of 
      Capsicum chinense Jacq. zygotic and somatic embryogenesis. HPLC quantification 
      determined that the levels of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) increase as the zygotic or 
      somatic embryogenesis progresses, being higher at maturity, thus supporting a 
      positive correlation between embryo cell differentiation and IAA increase. A 
      monoclonal anti-IAA-antibody was used to detect IAA levels. Findings revealed a 
      dynamic pattern of auxin distribution along the different embryogenic embryonic 
      stages. In the early stages of zygotic embryos, the IAA gradient was observed in the 
      basal cells of the suspensor and the hypostases, suggesting that they are the 
      initial source of the IAA hormone. As embryogenesis proceeds, the dynamic of the IAA 
      gradient is displaced to the embryo and endosperm cells. In the case of induced 
      somatic embryogenesis, the IAA gradient was detected in the dividing cells of the 
      endodermis, from where pre-embryogenic cells emerge. However, the analysis of 
      somatic embryos revealed that IAA was homogeneously distributed. This study shows 
      evidence supporting a correlation between IAA levels during zygotic or somatic 
      embryogenesis in Capsicum chinense species.

TI  - Somatic Embryogenesis from Mature Embryos of Olea europaea L. cv. 'Galega Vulgar' 
      and Long-Term Management of Calli Morphogenic Capacity.
LID - 10.3390/plants9060758 [doi]

AB  - Several olive cultivars, characterized by high-quality olive oil show agronomical 
      issues such as excessive vigor, high susceptibility to biotic and abiotic stresses, 
      and low propagation ability. They are strong candidates for breeding based on new 
      technologies to improve their performance in a short period of time. For this 
      reason, the first step is developing efficient somatic embryogenesis (SE) protocols. 
      Somatic embryogenesis in olive is highly genotype-dependent for both adult tissues 
      and mature embryos as initial explants, requiring the development of specific 
      protocols for each genotype. Trials using cotyledons and radicles as initial 
      explants, isolated from ripe seeds from the Portuguese olive cv. 'Galega vulgar', 
      gave more than 95% calli development. Radicles proved to be the most responsive 
      tissue for SE induction, with an average of 2 embryos per callus after callus 
      transfer to expression medium, and 14 embryos per callus after subculture on the 
      olive cyclic embryogenesis medium (ECO). Embryogenic competence could be recovered 
      after several subcultures on ECO medium that maintained cyclic embryogenesis for an 
      indeterminate period of time. Embryo conversion and plant acclimatization were also 
      attained with high success rates. Media management for cyclic embryogenesis 
      maintenance is of general importance for SE protocols in any olive genotype. Somatic 
      embryogenesis was thus attained for the first time in embryo-derived explants of cv. 
      'Galega vulgar'.

TI  - The MADS-domain factor AGAMOUS-Like18 promotes somatic embryogenesis.
LID - kiab553 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/plphys/kiab553 [doi]
AB  - AGAMOUS-Like 18 (AGL18) is a MADS domain transcription factor that is structurally 
      related to AGAMOUS-Like 15 (AGL15). Here we show that, like AGL15, AGL18 can promote 
      somatic embryogenesis (SE) when ectopically expressed in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis 
      thaliana). Based on loss-of-function mutants, AGL15 and AGL18 have redundant 
      functions in developmental processes such as SE. To understand the nature of this 
      redundancy, we undertook a number of studies to look at the interaction between 
      these factors. We studied the genome-wide direct targets of AGL18 to characterize 
      its roles at the molecular level using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-SEQ 
      combined with RNA-SEQ. The results demonstrated that AGL18 binds to thousands of 
      sites in the genome. Comparison of ChIP-SEQ data for AGL15 and AGL18 revealed 
      substantial numbers of genes bound by both AGL15 and AGL18, but there were also 
      differences. GO analysis revealed that target genes were enriched for seed, embryo, 
      and reproductive development as well as hormone and stress responses. The results 
      also demonstrated that AGL15 and AGL18 interact in a complex regulatory loop, where 
      AGL15 inhibited transcript accumulation of AGL18, while AGL18 increased AGL15 
      transcript accumulation. Co-immunoprecipitation revealed an interaction between 
      AGL18 and AGL15 in somatic embryo tissue. The binding and expression analyses 
      revealed a complex crosstalk and interactions among embryo transcription factors and 
      their target genes. In addition, our study also revealed that phosphorylation of 
      AGL18 and AGL15 was crucial for the promotion of SE.

TI  - Current Perspectives on the Auxin-Mediated Genetic Network that Controls the 
      Induction of Somatic Embryogenesis in Plants.
LID - 10.3390/ijms21041333 [doi]
LID - 1333
AB  - Auxin contributes to almost every aspect of plant development and metabolism as well 
      as the transport and signalling of auxin-shaped plant growth and morphogenesis in 
      response to endo- and exogenous signals including stress conditions. Consistently 
      with the common belief that auxin is a central trigger of developmental changes in 
      plants, the auxin treatment of explants was reported to be an indispensable inducer 
      of somatic embryogenesis (SE) in a large number of plant species. Treating in 
      vitro-cultured tissue with auxins (primarily 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, which 
      is a synthetic auxin-like plant growth regulator) results in the extensive 
      reprogramming of the somatic cell transcriptome, which involves the modulation of 
      numerous SE-associated transcription factor genes (TFs). A number of SE-modulated 
      TFs that control auxin metabolism and signalling have been identified, and 
      conversely, the regulators of the auxin-signalling pathway seem to control the 
      SE-involved TFs. In turn, the different expression of the genes encoding the core 
      components of the auxin-signalling pathway, the AUXIN/INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACIDs 
      (Aux/IAAs) and AUXIN RESPONSE FACTORs (ARFs), was demonstrated to accompany SE 
      induction. Thus, the extensive crosstalk between the hormones, in particular, auxin 
      and the TFs, was revealed to play a central role in the SE-regulatory network. 
      Accordingly, LEAFY COTYLEDON (LEC1 and LEC2), BABY BOOM (BBM), AGAMOUS-LIKE15 
      (AGL15) and WUSCHEL (WUS) were found to constitute the central part of the complex 
      regulatory network that directs the somatic plant cell towards embryogenic 
      development in response to auxin. The revealing picture shows a high degree of 
      complexity of the regulatory relationships between the TFs of the SE-regulatory 
      network, which involve direct and indirect interactions and regulatory feedback 
      loops. This review examines the recent advances in studies on the auxin-controlled 
      genetic network, which is involved in the mechanism of SE induction and focuses on 
      the complex regulatory relationships between the down- and up-stream targets of the 
      SE-regulatory TFs. In particular, the outcomes from investigations on Arabidopsis, 
      which became a model plant in research on genetic control of SE, are presented.

TI  - Hyperosmotic stress-induced somatic embryogenesis and its continuous culture in 
      Japanese honewort (Cryptotaenia japonica).
PG  - 31-36
LID - 10.5511/plantbiotechnology.20.0910a [doi]
AB  - Japanese honewort (Cryptotaenia japonica) is consumed as a traditional vegetable and 
      has medicinal applications. In Japan, C. japonica is mainly produced using 
      hydroponic culture systems; however, damping-off is often caused by the adherence of 
      pathogens to its seeds. Therefore, the use of sterile artificial seeds in hydroponic 
      culture is likely to be effective for preventing disease. In this study, we 
      established methods for stress-induced somatic embryogenesis and artificial seed 
      production in Japanese honewort. Shoot apex explants from seedlings were treated 
      with 0.7 M sucrose as a hyperosmotic stress for 3 or 6 weeks, and then transferred 
      to stress-free conditions. Somatic embryos were formed after culture in stress-free 
      conditions for 7 weeks. Stress-treated shoot apex explants that formed somatic 
      embryos were cultured in Murashige and Skoog liquid medium with shaking. After 2 
      weeks of culture, approximately 800 somatic embryos were formed from each explant. 
      Somatic embryos were formed continuously during 37 weeks under the same culture 
      conditions. Thus, somatic embryogenesis was effectively induced in Japanese honewort 
      via hyperosmotic stress, and embryogenic competence was maintained under stress- and 
      phytohormone-free conditions. The somatic embryos produced by liquid culture were 
      used to produce artificial seeds by enveloping the embryos in whipped alginate gel 
      to avoid hypoxic conditions. The artificial seeds had a high germination rate (72%). 
      This system is suitable for the sterile, highly productive hydroponic culture of 
      Japanese honewort.

AB  - Some plant cells are able to rebuild new organs after tissue damage or in response 
      to definite stress treatments and/or exogenous hormone applications. Whole plants 
      can develop through de novo organogenesis or somatic embryogenesis. Recent findings 
      have enlarged our understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms required 
      for tissue reprogramming during plant regeneration. Genetic analyses also suggest 
      the key role of epigenetic regulation during de novo plant organogenesis. A deeper 
      understanding of plant regeneration might help us to enhance tissue culture 
      optimization, with multiple applications in plant micropropagation and green 
      biotechnology. In this review, we will provide additional insights into the 
      physiological and molecular framework of plant regeneration, including both direct 
      and indirect de novo organ formation and somatic embryogenesis, and we will discuss 
      the key role of intrinsic and extrinsic constraints for cell reprogramming during 
      plant regeneration.

      Eucalyptus.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Eucalyptus, a highly diverse genus of the Myrtaceae family, is the most 
      widely planted hardwood in the world due to its increasing importance for fiber and 
      energy. Somatic embryogenesis (SE) is one large-scale method to provide commercial 
      use of the vegetative propagation of Eucalyptus and dedifferentiation is a key step 
      for plant cells to become meristematic. However, little is known about the molecular 
      changes during the Eucalyptus SE. RESULTS: We compared the transcriptome profiles of 
      the differentiated and dedifferentiated tissues of two Eucalyptus species - E. 
      camaldulensis (high embryogenetic potential) and E. grandis x urophylla (low 
      embryogenetic potential). Initially, we identified 18,777 to 20,240 genes in all 
      samples. Compared to the differentiated tissues, we identified 9229 and 8989 
      differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the dedifferentiated tissues of E. 
      camaldulensis and E. grandis x urophylla, respectively, and 2687 up-regulated and 
      2581 down-regulated genes shared. Next, we identified 2003 up-regulated and 1958 
      down-regulated genes only in E. camaldulensis, including 6 somatic embryogenesis 
      receptor kinase, 17 ethylene, 12 auxin, 83 ribosomal protein, 28 zinc finger 
      protein, 10 heat shock protein, 9 histone, 122 cell wall related and 98 
      transcription factor genes. Genes from other families like ABA, arabinogalactan 
      protein and late embryogenesis abundant protein were also found to be specifically 
      dysregulated in the dedifferentiation process of E. camaldulensis. Further, we 
      identified 48,447 variants (SNPs and small indels) specific to E. camaldulensis, 
      including 13,434 exonic variants from 4723 genes (e.g., annexin, GN, ARF and 
      AP2-like ethylene-responsive transcription factor). qRT-PCR was used to confirm the 
      gene expression patterns in both E. camaldulensis and E. grandis x urophylla. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This is the first time to study the somatic embryogenesis of Eucalyptus 
      using transcriptome sequencing. It will improve our understanding of the molecular 
      mechanisms of somatic embryogenesis and dedifferentiation in Eucalyptus. Our results 
      provide a valuable resource for future studies in the field of Eucalyptus and will 
      benefit the Eucalyptus breeding program.

AB  - Butia odorata is a palm native to southern Brazil and Uruguay, not domesticated, 
      much appreciated for its fruits and economic potential. However, the extractivism 
      and the difficulty of propagation have led to the decline of natural populations. 
      The objective of this work was to prove the possibility of induction of somatic 
      embryogenesis in B. odorata. Mature zygotic embryos were induced in two media, MS 
      and Y3, combined with auxin 2,4-D and picloram in five concentrations (2,4-D: 0, 
      361.99, 452.49, 542.99 and 633.48 μM/L, picloram: 0, 50, 150, 300 and 450 μM/L). The 
      results promising during induction with the formation of embryogenic calli and 
      somatic embryos, however the regeneration of them was not efficient, this may be due 
      to the occurrence of somatic embryos fused during its development. The roots were 
      formed, but the aerial part remained molten, not completing its development. Auxin 
      picloram and Y3 medium provided the most adequate conditions for calogenesis, 
      formation of embryogenic callus and somatic embryos, with concentrations of 150, 300 
      and 450 μM/L. This is the first description of somatic embryogenesis in B. odorata 
      that will serve as the basis for future research and adjustments of the methodology 
      proposed here.

AB  - Transcriptome analysis of maize embryogenic callus and somatic embryos reveals 
      associated genes reprogramming, hormone signaling pathways and transcriptional 
      regulation involved in somatic embryogenesis in maize. Somatic embryos are widely 
      utilized in propagation and genetic engineering of crop plants. In our laboratory, 
      an elite maize inbred line Y423 that could generate intact somatic embryos was 
      obtained and applied to genetic transformation. To enhance our understanding of 
      regulatory mechanisms during maize somatic embryogenesis, we used RNA-based 
      sequencing (RNA-seq) to characterize the transcriptome of immature embryo (IE), 
      embryogenic callus (EC) and somatic embryo (SE) from maize inbred line Y423. The 
      number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in three pairwise comparisons 
      (IE-vs-EC, IE-vs-SE and EC-vs-SE) was 5767, 7084 and 1065, respectively. The 
      expression patterns of DEGs were separated into eight major clusters. Somatic 
      embryogenesis associated genes were mainly grouped into cluster A or B with an 
      expression trend toward up-regulation during dedifferentiation. GO annotation and 
      KEGG pathway analysis revealed that DEGs were implicated in plant hormone signal 
      transduction, stress response and metabolic process. Among the differentially 
      expressed transcription factors, the most frequently represented families were 
      associated with the common stress response or related to cell differentiation, 
      embryogenic patterning and embryonic maturation processes. Genes include hormone 
      response/transduction and stress response, as well as several transcription factors 
      were discussed in this study, which may be potential candidates for further analyses 
      regarding their roles in somatic embryogenesis. Furthermore, the temporal expression 
      patterns of candidate genes were analyzed to reveal their roles in somatic 
      embryogenesis. This transcriptomic data provide insights into future functional 
      studies, which will facilitate further dissections of the molecular mechanisms that 
      control maize somatic embryogenesis.

AB  - A somatic embryogenesis protocol was developed from the immature leaves of adult 
      plants of the macaw palm. Leaf explants from different regions of the palm heart 
      were used for callus initiation in a modified Y3 medium, supplemented with 2,4-D or 
      Picloram at 450 μM. Calli were separated from the leaf explants at 6-, 9- and 
      12-month periods and transferred to a fresh culture medium of the same composition. 
      They were multiplied for up to 120 days. Reduced concentrations of 2,4-D and 
      Picloram were used to differentiate somatic embryos. They were then germinated in a 
      medium without plant growth regulators. Morphological and anatomical analyses were 
      conducted at different stages of the embryogenic process. The best results for 
      callus induction were achieved by Picloram, when explants were maintained for up to 
      9 months on culture medium (64.9%). The farthest portions of the apical meristem 
      were those that provided the biggest calli formation. The formation of the somatic 
      embryos was observed from the calli multiplication phase. Reduction in 
      concentrations of growth regulators failed to promote the formation of complete 
      plants. Picloram at 450 μM promotes high callogenesis in leaf tissues of macaw palm, 
      with a potential for somatic embryo formation.

TI  - Telomere Length in Norway Spruce during Somatic Embryogenesis and Cryopreservation.
LID - 10.3390/plants10020416 [doi]
LID - 416
AB  - Telomeres i.e., termini of the eukaryotic chromosomes protect chromosomes during DNA 
      replication. Shortening of telomeres, either due to stress or ageing is related to 
      replicative cellular senescence. There is little information on the effect of 
      biotechnological methods, such as tissue culture via somatic embryogenesis (SE) or 
      cryopreservation on plant telomeres, even if these techniques are widely applied. 
      The aim of the present study was to examine telomeres of Norway spruce (Picea abies 
      (L.) Karst.) during SE initiation, proliferation, embryo maturation, and 
      cryopreservation to reveal potential ageing or stress-related effects that could 
      explain variation observed at SE process. Altogether, 33 genotypes from 25 families 
      were studied. SE initiation containing several stress factors cause telomere 
      shortening in Norway spruce. Following initiation, the telomere length of the 
      embryogenic tissues (ETs) and embryos produced remains unchanged up to one year of 
      culture, with remarkable genotypic variation. Being prolonged in vitro culture can, 
      however, shorten the telomeres and should be avoided. This is achieved by successful 
      cryopreservation treatment preserving telomere length. Somatic embryo production 
      capacity of the ETs was observed to vary a lot not only among the genotypes, but 
      also from one timepoint to another. No connection between embryo production and 
      telomere length was found, so this variation remains unexplained.

TI  - Protocol development for somatic embryogenesis, SSR markers and genetic modification 
      of Stipagrostis pennata (Trin.) De Winter.
PG  - 70
LID - 10.1186/s13007-021-00768-9 [doi]
LID - 70
AB  - BACKGROUND: Stipagrostis pennata (Trin.) De Winter is an important species for 
      fixing sand in shifting and semi-fixed sandy lands, for grazing, and potentially as 
      a source of lignocellulose fibres for pulp and paper industry. The seeds have low 
      viability, which limits uses for revegetation. Somatic embryogenesis offers an 
      alternative method for obtaining large numbers of plants from limited seed sources. 
      RESULTS: A protocol for plant regeneration from somatic embryos of S. pennata was 
      developed. Somatic embryogenesis was induced on Murashige & Skoog (MS) medium 
      supplemented with 3 mg·L(-1) 2,4-D subsequently shoots were induced on MS medium and 
      supplemented with 5 mg·L(-1) zeatin riboside. The highest shoots induction was 
      obtained when embryogenic callus derived from mature embryos (96%) in combination 
      with MS filter-sterilized medium was used from Khuzestan location. The genetic 
      stability of regenerated plants was analysed using ten simple sequence repeats (SSR) 
      markers from S. pennata which showed no somaclonal variation in regenerated plants 
      from somatic embryos of S. pennata. The regenerated plants of S. pennata showed 
      genetic stability without any somaclonal variation for the four pairs of primers 
      that gave the expected amplicon sizes. This data seems very reliable as three of the 
      PCR products belonged to the coding region of the genome. Furthermore, stable 
      expression of GUS was obtained after Agrobacterium-mediated transformation using a 
      super binary vector carried by a bacterial strain LBA4404. CONCLUSION: To our 
      knowledge, the current work is the first attempt to develop an in vitro protocol for 
      somatic embryogenesis including the SSR marker analyses of regenerated plants, and 
      Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of S. pennata that can be used for its 
      large-scale production for commercial purposes.

TI  - Small Non-Coding RNAs at the Crossroads of Regulatory Pathways Controlling Somatic 
      Embryogenesis in Seed Plants.
LID - 10.3390/plants10030504 [doi]
LID - 504
AB  - Small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) are molecules with important regulatory functions 
      during development and environmental responses across all groups of terrestrial 
      plants. In seed plants, the development of a mature embryo from the zygote follows a 
      synchronized cell division sequence, and growth and differentiation events regulated 
      by highly regulated gene expression. However, given the distinct features of the 
      initial stages of embryogenesis in gymnosperms and angiosperms, it is relevant to 
      investigate to what extent such differences emerge from differential regulation 
      mediated by sncRNAs. Within these, the microRNAs (miRNAs) are the best characterized 
      class, and while many miRNAs are conserved and significantly represented across 
      angiosperms and other seed plants during embryogenesis, some miRNA families are 
      specific to some plant lineages. Being a model to study zygotic embryogenesis and a 
      relevant biotechnological tool, we systematized the current knowledge on the 
      presence and characterization of miRNAs in somatic embryogenesis (SE) of seed 
      plants, pinpointing the miRNAs that have been reported to be associated with SE in 
      angiosperm and gymnosperm species. We start by conducting an overview of sncRNA 
      expression profiles in the embryonic tissues of seed plants. We then highlight the 
      miRNAs described as being involved in the different stages of the SE process, from 
      its induction to the full maturation of the somatic embryos, adding references to 
      zygotic embryogenesis when relevant, as a contribution towards a better 
      understanding of miRNA-mediated regulation of SE.

AB  - An efficient regeneration system via shoot organogenesis and somatic embryogenesis 
      from in vitro leaf and root explants was established for Scaevola sericea for the 
      first time. The highest axillary shoot proliferation coefficient (4.8) was obtained 
      on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 1.0 mg/L 6-benzyladenine (BA) 
      and 0.1 mg/L α-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) every 45 days. Young in vitro leaves and 
      roots, which were used as explants, were cultured onto medium supplemented with 
      different plant growth regulators. Our results showed that only cytokinins BA and 
      thidiazuron (TDZ), could induce adventitious shoots and somatic embryos from leaf 
      and root explants. The optimal medium to achieve this was MS medium supplemented 
      with 2.5 mg/L BA and which induced most adventitious shoots (2.7) and somatic 
      embryos (17.3) from leaf explants within 30 days. From root explants, 1.1 
      adventitious shoots and 7.6 somatic embryos could be induced on MS medium 
      supplemented with 2.5 mg/L TDZ. Histological observation showed that both somatic 
      embryos and adventitious shoots were originated from homogeneous parenchyma and the 
      development of somatic embryos was visible. Maximum rooting percentage (99.0%) was 
      achieved on half-strength MS medium supplemented with 2.5 mg/L NAA. Well-rooted 
      plantlets, which were transplanted into a substrate of pure river sand, displayed a 
      high survival percentage of 91.7% after transplanting for 45 days while the best 
      substrate for plantlet growth was river sand: coral sand (1:1).

AB  - Many studies in the model species Arabidopsis thaliana characterized genes involved 
      in embryo formation. However, much remains to be learned about the portfolio of 
      genes that are involved in signal transduction and transcriptional regulation during 
      plant embryo development in other species, particularly in an evolutionary context, 
      especially considering that some genes involved in embryo patterning are not 
      exclusive of land plants. This study, used a combination of domain architecture 
      phylostratigraphy and phylogenetic reconstruction to investigate the evolutionary 
      history of embryo patterning and auxin metabolism (EPAM) genes in Viridiplantae. 
      This approach shed light on the co-optation of auxin metabolism and other molecular 
      mechanisms that contributed to the radiation of land plants, and specifically to 
      embryo formation. These results have potential to assist conservation programs, by 
      directing the development of tools for obtaining somatic embryos. In this context, 
      we employed this methodology with critically endangered and non-model species 
      Araucaria angustifolia, the Brazilian pine, which is current focus of conservation 
      efforts using somatic embryogenesis. So far, this approach had little success since 
      somatic embryos fail to completely develop. By profiling the expression of genes 
      that we identified as necessary for the emergence of land-plant embryos, we found 
      striking differences between zygotic and somatic embryos that might explain the 
      developmental arrest and be used to improve A. angustifolia somatic culture.

AB  - This study aimed to obtain information from several embryogenic cell (EC) genotypes 
      analyzing the factors that affect somatic embryogenesis (SE) initiation in sugi 
      (Cryptomeria japonica, Cupressaceae) to apply them in the improvement of protocols 
      for efficient induction of embryogenic cell lines (ECLs). The results of several 
      years of experiments including studies on the influence of initial explant, seed 
      collection time, and explant genotype as the main factors affecting SE initiation 
      from male-fertile, male-sterile, and polycross-pollinated-derived seeds are 
      described. Initiation frequencies depending on the plant genotype varied from 1.35 
      to 57.06%. The best induction efficiency was achieved when seeds were collected on 
      mid-July using the entire megagametophyte as initial explants. The extrusion of ECs 
      started approximately after 2 weeks of culture, and the establishment of ECLs was 
      observed mostly 4 weeks after extrusion on media with or without plant growth 
      regulators (PGRs). Subsequently, induced ECLs were maintained and proliferated on 
      media with PGRs by 2-3-week-interval subculture routines. Although, the initial 
      explant, collection time, and culture condition played important roles in ECL 
      induction, the genotype of the plant material of sugi was the most influential 
      factor in SE initiation.

TI  - Direct somatic embryogenesis and flow cytometric assessment of ploidy stability in 
      regenerants of Caladium × hortulanum 'Fancy'.
LID - 10.1007/s13353-021-00663-y [doi]
AB  - Caladium × hortulanum 'Fancy' is an important ornamental plant grown in pots and 
      landscapes and known for its colorful leaves often used for interior decorations. In 
      this work, we present a method of in vitro regeneration from three explants source 
      through direct somatic embryogenesis (DSE) wherein the regenerated plants were 
      screened for ploidy changes through flow cytometry analysis. Tuber, leaf and petiole 
      explants were cultured on MS basal medium supplemented with 1-napthalene acetic acid 
      (NAA), 6-benzyl amino purine (BAP) and N-phenyl-N'-1, 2,3-thiadiazol-5-ylurea (TDZ) 
      concentrations. Tuber explants induced highest direct somatic embryos on NAA (1 mg 
      L(- 1)) + BAP (0.5 mg L(- 1)) with 55.6 mean number of embryos per explant while as 
      leaf and petiole explants amended with 1 mg L(- 1) TDZ developed 18.7 and 12.27 mean 
      number of embryos per explant respectively. The highest embryo conversion frequency 
      was achieved on BAP (2 mg L(- 1)) + NAA (0.2 mg L(- 1)) with 44.2, 18.7 and 7.5 mean 
      number of plantlets produced per tuber, leaf and petiole explant respectively after 
      4 weeks of culture. Plantlets were later rooted and maximum number of roots (6.33) 
      per shoot was achieved on 2 mg L(- 1) indolebutyric acid amended medium. Description 
      of the process of DSE is presented through the histological and SEM evidences. The 
      2C DNA content of field grown plants and the DSE regenerants evaluated under flow 
      cytometric analysis were 8.06 pg and 8.28 pg respectively showing no ploidy changes. 
      Hence, a successful protocol of inducing direct somatic embryos from three explant 
      types with efficient embryo conversion frequency was obtained with regenerants 
      showing similar DNA ploidy as that of their parent plants.

AB  - Tilia species are valuable woody species due to their beautiful shape and role as 
      honey trees. Somatic embryogenesis can be an alternative method for mass propagation 
      of T. amurensis. However, the molecular mechanisms of T. amurensis somatic 
      embryogenesis are yet to be known. Here, we conducted comparative transcriptional 
      analysis during somatic embryogenesis of T. amurensis. RNA-Seq identified 1505 
      differentially expressed genes, including developmental regulatory genes. Auxin 
      related genes such as YUC, AUX/IAA and ARF and signal transduction pathway related 
      genes including LEA and SERK were differentially regulated during somatic 
      embryogenesis. Also, B3 domain family (LEC2, FUS3), VAL and PKL, the regulatory 
      transcription factors, were differentially expressed by somatic embryo developmental 
      stages. Our results could provide plausible pathway of signaling somatic 
      embryogenesis of T. amurensis, and serve an important resource for further studies 
      in direct somatic embryogenesis in woody plants.

AB  - Changes in the chemical environment at the maturation stage in Pinus spp. somatic 
      embryogenesis will be a determinant factor in the conversion of somatic embryos to 
      plantlets. Furthermore, the study of biochemical and morphological aspects of the 
      somatic embryos could enable the improvement of somatic embryogenesis in Pinus spp. 
      In the present work, the influence of different amino acid combinations, 
      carbohydrate sources, and concentrations at the maturation stage of Pinus radiata D. 
      Don and Pinus halepensis Mill. was analyzed. In P. radiata, the maturation medium 
      supplemented with 175 mM of sucrose and an increase in the amino acid mixture (1,100 
      mgL(-1) of L-glutamine, 1,050 mgL(-1) of L-asparagine, 350 mgL(-1) of L-arginine, 
      and 35 mgL(-1) of L-proline) promoted bigger embryos, with a larger stem diameter 
      and an increase in the number of roots in the germinated somatic embryos, improving 
      the acclimatization success of this species. In P. halepensis, the maturation medium 
      supplemented with 175 mM of maltose improved the germination of somatic embryos. The 
      increase in the amount of amino acids in the maturation medium increased the levels 
      of putrescine in the germinated somatic embryos of P. halepensis. We detected 
      significant differences in the amounts of polyamines between somatic plantlets of P. 
      radiata and P. halepensis; putrescine was less abundant in both species. For the 
      first time, in P. radiata and P. halepensis somatic embryogenesis, we detected the 
      presence of cadaverine, and its concentration changed according to the species.

AB  - The effects of growth regulators, namely, 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) and thidiazuron 
      (TDZ), on the morphogenic capacity of 13 cultivars of clematis plants, in terms of 
      their morphological structure formation, shoot regeneration, and somatic embryo 
      development, are presented. The clematis cultivars 'Alpinist,' 'Ay-Nor,' 'Bal 
      Tsvetov,' 'Crimson Star,' 'Crystal Fountain,' 'Kosmicheskaya Melodiya,' 'Lesnaya 
      Opera,' 'Madame Julia Correvon,' 'Nevesta,' 'Nikitsky Rosovyi,' 'Nikolay Rubtsov,' 
      'Serenada Kryma,' and 'Vechniy Zov' were taken in collection plots of the Nikita 
      Botanical Gardens for use in study. After explant sterilization with 70% ethanol (1 
      min), 0.3-0.4% Cl(2) (15 min), and 1% thimerosal (10 min), 1-cm long segments with a 
      single node were introduced to an in vitro culture. The explants were established on 
      the basal MS medium supplemented with BAP (2.20-8.90 μM) and 0.049 μM NAA, or TDZ 
      (3.0; 6.0, and 9.0 μM) with 30 g/L sucrose and 9 g/L agar. The medium with 0.89 μM 
      BAP served as the control. Culture vessels and test tubes with the explants were 
      maintained in plant growth chamber-controlled conditions: with a 16-h photoperiod, 
      under cool-white light fluorescent lamps with a light intensity of 37.5 μmol m(-2) 
      s(-1), at a temperature of 24 ± 1°C. Histological analysis demonstrated that 
      adventitious bud and somatic embryo formation in studied clematis cultivars occurred 
      at numerous areas of active meristematic cell zones. The main role of plant growth 
      regulators and its concentrations were demonstrated. It was determined that maximum 
      adventitious microshoot regeneration without any morphological abnormalities formed 
      on the media supplemented with BAP or TDZ. 4.40 μM BAP, or 6.0 μM TDZ were optimal 
      cytokinin concentrations for micropropagation. The explants of 'Alpinist,' 'Ay-Nor,' 
      'Crimson Star,' 'Crystal Fountain,' 'Nevesta,' and 'Serenada Kryma' cultivars 
      displayed high morphogenetic capacity under in vitro culturing. During indirect 
      somatic embryogenesis, light intensity 37.5 μmol m(-2) s(-1) stimulated a 
      higher-number somatic embryo formation and a temperature of 26°C affected somatic 
      embryo development. Active formation of primary and secondary somatic embryos was 
      also demonstrated. 2.20 μM BAP with 0.09 μM IBA affected the high-number somatic 
      embryo formation for eight cultivars. Secondary somatic embryogenesis by the same 
      concentration of BAP was induced. The frequency of secondary somatic embryogenesis 
      was higher in 'Crystal Fountain' (100%), 'Crimson Star' (100%), 'Nevesta' (97%), and 
      'Ay-Nor' (92%) cultivars. Based on these results, the methodology for direct somatic 
      embryogenesis and organogenesis of studied clematis cultivars has been developed.

TI  - Identification and expression analysis of histone modification gene (HM) family 
      during somatic embryogenesis of oil palm.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Oil palm (Elaeis guineensis, Jacq.) is an important vegetable 
      oil-yielding plant. Somatic embryogenesis is a promising method to produce 
      large-scale elite clones to meet the demand for palm oil. The epigenetic mechanisms 
      such as histone modifications have emerged as critical factors during somatic 
      embryogenesis. These histone modifications are associated with the regulation of 
      various genes controlling somatic embryogenesis. To date, none of the information is 
      available on the histone modification gene (HM) family in oil palm. RESULTS: We 
      reported the identification of 109 HM gene family members including 48 HMTs, 27 
      HDMs, 13 HATs, and 21 HDACs in the oil palm genome. Gene structural and motif 
      analysis of EgHMs showed varied exon-intron organization and with conserved motifs 
      among them. The identified 109 EgHMs were distributed unevenly across 16 chromosomes 
      and displayed tandem duplication in oil palm genome. Furthermore, relative 
      expression analysis showed the differential expressional pattern of 99 candidate 
      EgHM genes at different stages (non-embryogenic, embryogenic, somatic embryo) of 
      somatic embryogenesis process in oil palm, suggesting the EgHMs play vital roles in 
      somatic embryogenesis. Our study laid a foundation to understand the regulatory 
      roles of several EgHM genes during somatic embryogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: A total of 
      109 histone modification gene family members were identified in the oil palm genome 
      via genome-wide analysis. The present study provides insightful information 
      regarding HM gene's structure, their distribution, duplication in oil palm genome, 
      and also their evolutionary relationship with other HM gene family members in 
      Arabidopsis and rice. Finally, our study provided an essential role of oil palm HM 
      genes during somatic embryogenesis process.

AB  - Cell-to-cell signalling is a major mechanism controlling plant morphogenesis. 
      Transport of signalling molecules through plasmodesmata is one way in which plants 
      promote or restrict intercellular signalling over short distances. Plasmodesmata are 
      membrane-lined pores between cells that regulate the intercellular flow of 
      signalling molecules through changes in their size, creating symplasmic fields of 
      connected cells. Here we examine the role of plasmodesmata and symplasmic 
      communication in the establishment of plant cell totipotency, using somatic embryo 
      induction from Arabidopsis explants as a model system. Cell-to-cell communication 
      was evaluated using fluorescent tracers, supplemented with histological and 
      ultrastructural analysis, and correlated with expression of a WOX2 embryo reporter. 
      We showed that embryogenic cells are isolated symplasmically from non-embryogenic 
      cells regardless of the explant type (immature zygotic embryos or seedlings) and 
      inducer system (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid or the BABY BOOM (BBM) transcription 
      factor), but that the symplasmic domains in different explants differ with respect 
      to the maximum size of molecule capable of moving through the plasmodesmata. Callose 
      deposition in plasmodesmata preceded WOX2 expression in future sites of somatic 
      embryo development, but later was greatly reduced in WOX2-expressing domains. 
      Callose deposition was also associated with a decrease DR5 auxin response in 
      embryogenic tissue. Treatment of explants with the callose biosynthesis inhibitor 
      2-deoxy-D-glucose supressed somatic embryo formation in all three systems studied, 
      and also blocked the observed decrease in DR5 expression. Together these data 
      suggest that callose deposition at plasmodesmata is required for symplasmic 
      isolation and establishment of cell totipotency in Arabidopsis.

AB  - Plasmodesmata (PD) are cytoplasmic and membrane-lined microchannels that enable 
      symplasmic communication in plants, which is involved in the regulation of cell 
      differentiation. The presented results emphasise the qualitative and quantitative 
      analyses of PD, which are the basis of the symplasmic communication. The cells that 
      initiate various development programmes create symplasmic domains that are 
      characterised by different degrees of symplasmic communication. Changes in 
      symplasmic communication are caused by the presence or absence of PD and/or the 
      ability of signals to move through them. In the presented studies, somatic 
      embryogenesis was used to describe the characteristics of the PD within and between 
      the symplasmic domains in explants of the Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh ecotype 
      Columbia-0 and 35S:BBM transgenic line. Transmission electron microscopy was used to 
      describe the cells that regain totipotency/pluripotency during somatic 
      embryogenesis, as well as the number and shape of the PD in the different symplasmic 
      domains of the explants and somatic embryos. Array tomography was used to create a 
      3D reconstruction of the protodermal cells of the somatic embryos with particular 
      emphasis on the PD distribution in the cell walls. The results showed that there 
      were different frequencies of the PD within and between the symplasmic domain that 
      emerges during somatic embryogenesis and between the Col-0 and 35S:BBM somatic 
      embryos with regard to the differences in the shape of the PD.

AB  - Following fertilization in flowering plants (angiosperms), egg and sperm cells unite 
      to form the zygote, which generates an entire new organism through a process called 
      embryogenesis. In this review, we provide a comparative perspective on early zygotic 
      embryogenesis in flowering plants by using the Poaceae maize and rice as monocot 
      grass and crop models as well as Arabidopsis as a eudicot model of the Brassicaceae 
      family. Beginning with the activation of the egg cell, we summarize and discuss the 
      process of maternal-to-zygotic transition in plants, also taking recent work on 
      parthenogenesis and haploid induction into consideration. Aspects like imprinting, 
      which is mainly associated with endosperm development and somatic embryogenesis, are 
      not considered. Controversial findings about the timing of zygotic genome activation 
      as well as maternal versus paternal contribution to zygote and early embryo 
      development are highlighted. The establishment of zygotic polarity, asymmetric 
      division, and apical and basal cell lineages represents another chapter in which we 
      also examine and compare the role of major signaling pathways, cell fate genes, and 
      hormones in early embryogenesis. Except for the model Arabidopsis, little is known 
      about embryopatterning and the establishment of the basic body plan in angiosperms. 
      Using available in situ hybridization, RNA-sequencing, and marker data, we try to 
      compare how and when stem cell niches are established. Finally, evolutionary aspects 
      of plant embryo development are discussed.

TI  - Genome-wide identification of microRNAs involved in the somatic embryogenesis of 
      Eucalyptus.
LID - 10.1093/g3journal/jkab070 [doi]
LID - jkab070
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs (18-24 nt) and function in many 
      biological processes in plants. Although Eucalyptus trees are widely planted across 
      the world, our understanding of the miRNA regulation in the somatic embryogenesis 
      (SE) of Eucalyptus is still poor. Here we reported, for the first time, the miRNA 
      profiles of differentiated and dedifferentiated tissues of two Eucalyptus species 
      and identified miRNAs involved in SE of Eucalyptus. Stem and tissue culture-induced 
      callus were obtained from the subculture seedlings of E. camaldulensis and E. 
      grandis x urophylla and were used as differentiated and dedifferentiated samples, 
      respectively. Small RNA sequencing generated 304.2 million clean reads for the 
      Eucalyptus samples (n = 3) and identified 888 miRNA precursors (197 known and 691 
      novel) for Eucalyptus. These miRNAs were mainly distributed in chromosomes Chr03, 
      Chr05, and Chr08 and can produce 46 miRNA clusters. Then, we identified 327 and 343 
      differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRs) in the dedifferentiation process of E. 
      camaldulensis and E. grandis x urophylla, respectively. DEmiRs shared by the two 
      Eucalyptus species might be involved in the development of embryonic callus, such as 
      MIR156, MIR159, MIR160, MIR164, MIR166, MIR169, MIR171, MIR399, and MIR482. Notably, 
      we identified 81 upregulated and 67 downregulated miRNAs specific to E. 
      camaldulensis, which might be associated with the high embryogenic potential. Target 
      prediction and functional analysis showed that they might be involved in longevity 
      regulating and plant hormone signal transduction pathways. Further, using the gene 
      expression profiles, we observed the negative regulation of miRNA-target pairs, such 
      as MIR160~ARF18, MIR396~GRF6, MIR166~ATHB15/HD-ZIP, and MIR156/MIR157~SPL1. 
      Interestingly, transcription factors such as WRKY, MYB, GAMYB, TCP4, and PIL1 were 
      found to be regulated by the DEmiRs. The genes encoding PIL1 and RPS21C, regulated 
      by upregulated miRNAs (e.g., egd-N-miR63-5p, egd-N-miR63-5p, and MIR169,) were 
      downregulated exclusively in the dedifferentiation of E. camaldulensis. This is the 
      first time to study the miRNA regulation in the dedifferentiation process of 
      Eucalyptus and it will provide a valuable resource for future studies. More 
      importantly, it will improve our understanding of miRNA regulation during the 
      somatic embryogenesis of Eucalyptus and benefit the Eucalyptus breeding program.

AB  - Apomixis, is an asexual mode of seed formation resulting in genetically identical or 
      clonal seed with a maternal genotype. Apomixis has not been reported in seed crops 
      where its flexible application in plant breeding could accelerate delivery of new 
      varieties. By contrast, a sporophytic form of apomixis termed nucellar or 
      adventitious embryony is common in the Rutaceae containing Citrus crop species. 
      Here, multiple embryos develop from the maternal, somatic, nucellar cells of the 
      ovule. They are incorporated into the enlarging embryo sac containing the sexually 
      derived zygotic embryo and endosperm, which are products of double fertilization. 
      Recent research has provided insights to the molecular basis for nucellar embryony. 
      Here, we review the current understanding of the initiation, genetic basis and 
      evolution of nucellar embryony in Citrus, and discuss prospects for future study and 
      breeding applications of Citrus sporophytic apomixis.

TI  - In Vitro Plant Regeneration in Conifers: The Role of WOX and KNOX Gene Families.
LID - 10.3390/genes12030438 [doi]
LID - 438
AB  - Conifers are a group of woody plants with an enormous economic and ecological 
      importance. Breeding programs are necessary to select superior varieties for 
      planting, but they have many limitations due to the biological characteristics of 
      conifers. Somatic embryogenesis (SE) and de novo organogenesis (DNO) from in vitro 
      cultured tissues are two ways of plant mass propagation that help to overcome this 
      problem. Although both processes are difficult to achieve in conifers, they offer 
      advantages like a great efficiency, the possibilities to cryopreserve the 
      embryogenic lines, and the ability of multiplying adult trees (the main bottleneck 
      in conifer cloning) through DNO. Moreover, SE and DNO represent appropriate 
      experimental systems to study the molecular bases of developmental processes in 
      conifers such as embryogenesis and shoot apical meristem (SAM) establishment. Some 
      of the key genes regulating these processes belong to the WOX and KNOX homeobox gene 
      families, whose function has been widely described in Arabidopsis thaliana. The 
      sequences and roles of these genes in conifers are similar to those found in 
      angiosperms, but some particularities exist, like the presence of WOXX, a gene that 
      putatively participates in the establishment of SAM in somatic embryos and plantlets 
      of Pinus pinaster.

TI  - MicroRNA Zma-miR528 Versatile Regulation on Target mRNAs during Maize Somatic 
      Embryogenesis.
LID - 10.3390/ijms22105310 [doi]
LID - 5310
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate the accumulation and 
      translation of their target mRNAs through sequence complementarity. miRNAs have 
      emerged as crucial regulators during maize somatic embryogenesis (SE) and plant 
      regeneration. A monocot-specific miRNA, mainly accumulated during maize SE, is 
      zma-miR528. While several targets have been described for this miRNA, the regulation 
      has not been experimentally confirmed for the SE process. Here, we explored the 
      accumulation of zma-miR528 and several predicted targets during embryogenic callus 
      induction, proliferation, and plantlet regeneration using the maize cultivar VS-535. 
      We confirmed the cleavage site for all tested zma-miR528 targets; however, PLC1 
      showed very low levels of processing. The abundance of zma-miR528 slightly decreased 
      in one month-induced callus compared to the immature embryo (IE) explant tissue. 
      However, it displayed a significant increase in four-month sub-cultured callus, 
      coincident with proliferation establishment. In callus-regenerated plantlets, 
      zma-miR528 greatly decreased to levels below those observed in the initial explant. 
      Three of the target transcripts (MATE, bHLH, and SOD1a) showed an inverse 
      correlation with the miRNA abundance in total RNA samples at all stages. Using 
      polysome fractionation, zma-miR528 was detected in the polysome fraction and 
      exhibited an inverse distribution with the PLC1 target, which was not observed at 
      total RNA. Accordingly, we conclude that zma-miR528 regulates multiple target mRNAs 
      during the SE process by promoting their degradation, translation inhibition or 
      both.

AB  - Plant somatic cells can be reprogrammed into totipotent embryonic cells that are 
      able to form differentiated embryos in a process called somatic embryogenesis (SE), 
      by hormone treatment or through overexpression of certain transcription factor 
      genes, such as BABY BOOM (BBM). Here we show that overexpression of the AT-HOOK 
      MOTIF CONTAINING NUCLEAR LOCALIZED 15 (AHL15) gene induces formation of somatic 
      embryos on Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings in the absence of hormone treatment. 
      During zygotic embryogenesis, AHL15 expression starts early in embryo development, 
      and AH15 and other AHL genes are required for proper embryo patterning and 
      development beyond the globular stage. Moreover, AHL15 and several of its homologs 
      are upregulated and required for SE induction upon hormone treatment, and they are 
      required for efficient BBM-induced SE as downstream targets of BBM. A significant 
      number of plants derived from AHL15 overexpression-induced somatic embryos are 
      polyploid. Polyploidisation occurs by endomitosis specifically during the initiation 
      of SE, and is caused by strong heterochromatin decondensation induced by AHL15 
      overexpression.

TI  - Cryopreservation of Woody Crops: The Avocado Case.
LID - 10.3390/plants10050934 [doi]
LID - 934
AB  - Recent development and implementation of crop cryopreservation protocols has 
      increased the capacity to maintain recalcitrant seeded germplasm collections via 
      cryopreserved in vitro material. To preserve the greatest possible plant genetic 
      resources globally for future food security and breeding programs, it is essential 
      to integrate in situ and ex situ conservation methods into a cohesive conservation 
      plan. In vitro storage using tissue culture and cryopreservation techniques offers 
      promising complementary tools that can be used to promote this approach. These 
      techniques can be employed for crops difficult or impossible to maintain in seed 
      banks for long-term conservation. This includes woody perennial plants, recalcitrant 
      seed crops or crops with no seeds at all and vegetatively or clonally propagated 
      crops where seeds are not true-to-type. Many of the world's most important crops for 
      food, nutrition and livelihoods, are vegetatively propagated or have recalcitrant 
      seeds. This review will look at ex situ conservation, namely field repositories and 
      in vitro storage for some of these economically important crops, focusing on 
      conservation strategies for avocado. To date, cultivar-specific multiplication 
      protocols have been established for maintaining multiple avocado cultivars in tissue 
      culture. Cryopreservation of avocado somatic embryos and somatic embryogenesis have 
      been successful. In addition, a shoot-tip cryopreservation protocol has been 
      developed for cryo-storage and regeneration of true-to-type clonal avocado plants.

TI  - Global Transcriptome and Coexpression Network Analyses Reveal New Insights Into 
      Somatic Embryogenesis in Hybrid Sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua × Liquidambar 
      formosana).

AB  - Somatic embryogenesis (SE) is a process of somatic cells that dedifferentiate to 
      totipotent embryonic stem cells and generate embryos in vitro. Despite recent 
      scientific headway in deciphering the difficulties of somatic embryogenesis, the 
      overall picture of key genes, pathways, and co-expression networks regulating SE is 
      still fragmented. Therefore, deciphering the molecular basis of somatic 
      embryogenesis of hybrid sweetgum remains pertinent. In the present study, we 
      analyzed the transcriptome profiles and gene expression regulation changes via RNA 
      sequencing from three distinct developmental stages of hybrid sweetgum: 
      non-embryogenic callus (NEC), embryogenic callus (EC), and redifferentiation. 
      Comparative transcriptome analysis showed that 19,957 genes were differentially 
      expressed in ten pairwise comparisons of SE. Among these, plant hormone 
      signaling-related genes, especially the auxin and cytokinin signaling components, 
      were significantly enriched in NEC and EC early. The K-means method was used to 
      identify multiple transcription factors, including HB-WOX, B3-ARF, AP2/ERF, and GRFs 
      (growth regulating factors). These transcription factors showed distinct stage- or 
      tissue-specific expression patterns mirroring each of the 12 superclusters to which 
      they belonged. For example, the WOX transcription factor family was expressed only 
      at NEC and EC stages, ARF transcription factor was expressed in EC early, and GRFs 
      was expressed in late SE. It was noteworthy that the AP2/ERF transcription factor 
      family was expressed during the whole SE process, but almost not in roots, stems and 
      leaves. A weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used in 
      conjunction with the gene expression profiles to recognize the genes and modules 
      that may associate with specific tissues and stages. We constructed co-expression 
      networks and revealed 22 gene modules. Four of these modules with properties 
      relating to embryonic potential, early somatic embryogenesis, and somatic embryo 
      development, as well as some hub genes, were identified for further functional 
      studied. Through a combination analysis of WGCNA and K-means, SE-related genes 
      including AUX22, ABI3, ARF3, ARF5, AIL1, AIL5, AGL15, WOX11, WOX9, IAA29, BBM1, 
      MYB36, LEA6, SMR4 and others were obtained, indicating that these genes play an 
      important role in the processes underlying the progression from EC to somatic 
      embryos (SEs) morphogenesis. The transcriptome information provided here will form 
      the foundation for future research on genetic transformation and epigenetic control 
      of plant embryogenesis at a molecular level. In follow-up studies, these data could 
      be used to construct a regulatory network for SE; Key genes obtained from 
      coexpression network analysis at each critical stage of somatic embryo can be 
      considered as potential candidate genes to verify these networks.

AB  - Histone methylation plays a crucial role in various biological processes, from 
      heterochromatin formation to transcriptional regulation. Currently, no information 
      is available regarding histone methylation modifiers in the important 
      rubber-producing plant Hevea brasiliensis. Here, we identified 47 histone 
      methyltransferase (HMT) genes and 25 histone demethylase (HDM) genes as possible 
      members of the histone methylation modifiers in the rubber tree genome. According to 
      the structural features of HMT and HDM, the HbHMTs were classified into two groups 
      (HbPRMs and HbSDGs), the HbHDMs have two groups (HbLSDs and HbJMJs). Expression 
      patterns were analyzed in five different tissues and at different phases of somatic 
      embryogenesis. HbSDG10, 21, 25, 33, HbJMJ2, 18, 20 were with high expression at 
      different phases of somatic embryogenesis. HbSDG10,14, 20, 21, 33 and HbPRMT4 were 
      expressed highly in anther, HbSDG14, 20, 21, 22, 23, 33, 35 and HbPRMT1 HbJMJ7 and 
      HbLSD1, 2, 3, 4 showed high expression levels in callus. HbSDG1, 7, 10, 13, 14, 18, 
      19, 21, 22, 23, 35, HbPRMT1, 8, HbJMJ5, 7, 11, 16, 20 and HbLSD2, 3, 4 were 
      expressed highly in somatic embryo. HbSDG10, 21, 25, 33, HbLSD2, 3 were expressed 
      highly in bud of regenerated plant. The analyses reveal that HbHMTs and HbHDMs 
      exhibit different expression patterns at different phases during somatic 
      embryogenesis, implying that some HbHMTs and HbHDMs play important roles during 
      somatic embryogenesis. This study provide fundamental information for further 
      studies on histone methylation in Hevea brasiliensis.

TI  - Autotetraploid Emergence via Somatic Embryogenesis in Vitis vinifera Induces Marked

AB  - Polyploidy plays an important role in plant adaptation to biotic and abiotic 
      stresses. Alterations of the ploidy in grapevine plants regenerated via somatic 
      embryogenesis (SE) may provide a source of genetic variability useful for the 
      improvement of agronomic characteristics of crops. In the grapevine, the SE 
      induction process may cause ploidy changes without alterations in DNA profile. In 
      the present research, tetraploid plants were observed for 9.3% of 'Frappato' 
      grapevine somatic embryos regenerated in medium supplemented with the growth 
      regulators β-naphthoxyacetic acid (10 µM) and N(6)-benzylaminopurine (4.4 µM). 
      Autotetraploid plants regenerated via SE without detectable changes in the DNA 
      profiles were transferred in field conditions to analyze the effect of 
      polyploidization. Different ploidy levels induced several anatomical and 
      morphological changes of the shoots and mature leaves. Alterations have been also 
      observed in stomata. The length and width of stomata of tetraploid leaves were 39.9 
      and 18.6% higher than diploids, respectively. The chloroplast number per guard cell 
      pair was higher (5.2%) in tetraploid leaves. On the contrary, the stomatal index was 
      markedly decreased (12%) in tetraploid leaves. The observed morphological 
      alterations might be useful traits for breeding of grapevine varieties in a changing 
      environment.

AB  - Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) is one of the world's premier lumber species and 
      somatic embryogenesis (SE) is the most promising method for rapid propagation of 
      superior tree genotypes. The development and optimization of SE protocols in 
      conifers is hindered by a lack of knowledge of the molecular basis of embryogenesis 
      and limited sequence data. In Arabidopsis, the LEAFY COTYLEDON1 (AtLEC1) gene is a 
      master regulator of embryogenesis that induces SE when expressed ectopically. We 
      isolated the LEC1 homologue from Douglas-fir, designated as PmLEC1. PmLEC1 
      expression in somatic embryos and developing seeds demonstrated a unique, 
      alternating pattern of expression with the highest levels during early stages of 
      embryogenesis. PmLEC1 protein accumulation during seed development correlated with 
      its transcriptional levels during early embryogenesis; however, substantial protein 
      levels persisted until 2 weeks on germination medium. Treatment of mature, 
      stratified seeds with 2,4-epibrassinolide, sorbitol, mannitol, or NaCl upregulated 
      PmLEC1 expression, which may provide strategies to induce SE from mature tissues. 
      Sequence analysis of the PmLEC1 gene revealed a 5' UTR intron containing binding 
      sites for transcription factors (TFs), such as ABI3, LEC2, FUS3, and AGL15, which 
      are critical regulators of embryogenesis in angiosperms. Regulatory elements for 
      these and other seed-specific TFs and biotic and abiotic signals were identified 
      within the PmLEC1 locus. Most importantly, functional analysis of PmLEC1 showed that 
      it rescued the Arabidopsis lec1-1 null mutant and, in the T2 generation, led to the 
      development of embryo-like structures, indicating a key role of PmLEC1 in the 
      regulation of embryogenesis.

AB  - Androgenesis, which entails cell fate redirection within the microgametophyte, is 
      employed widely for genetic gain in plant breeding programs. Moreover, 
      androgenesis-responsive species provide tractable systems for studying cell cycle 
      regulation, meiotic recombination, and apozygotic embryogenesis within plant cells. 
      Past research on androgenesis has focused on protocol development with emphasis on 
      temperature pretreatments of donor plants or floral buds, and tissue culture 
      optimization because androgenesis has different nutritional requirements than 
      somatic embryogenesis. Protocol development for new species and genotypes within 
      responsive species continues to the present day, but slowly. There is more focus 
      presently on understanding how protocols work in order to extend them to additional 
      genotypes and species. Transcriptomic and epigenetic analyses of induced microspores 
      have revealed some of the cellular and molecular responses required for or 
      associated with androgenesis. For example, microRNAs appear to regulate early 
      microspore responses to external stimuli; trichostatin-A, a histone deacetylase 
      inhibitor, acts as an epigenetic additive; ά-phytosulfokine, a five amino acid 
      sulfated peptide, promotes androgenesis in some species. Additionally, present work 
      on gene transfer and genome editing in microspores suggest that future endeavors 
      will likely incorporate greater precision with the genetic composition of 
      microspores used in doubled haploid breeding, thus likely to realize a greater 
      impact on crop improvement. In this review, we evaluate basic breeding applications 
      of androgenesis, explore the utility of genomics and gene editing technologies for 
      protocol development, and provide considerations to overcome genotype specificity 
      and morphogenic recalcitrance in non-model plant systems.

LID - 10.3390/plants9060702 [doi]

AB  - Plants generally have the highest regenerative ability because they show a high 
      degree of developmental plasticity. Although the basic principles of plant 
      regeneration date back many years, understanding the cellular, molecular, and 
      physiological mechanisms based on these principles is currently in progress. In 
      addition to the significant effects of some factors such as medium components, 
      phytohormones, explant type, and light on the regeneration ability of an explant, 
      recent reports evidence the involvement of molecular signals in organogenesis and 
      embryogenesis responses to explant wounding, induced plant cell death, and 
      phytohormones interaction. However, some cellular behaviors such as the occurrence 
      of somaclonal variations and abnormalities during the in vitro plant regeneration 
      process may be associated with adverse effects on the efficacy of plant 
      regeneration. A review of past studies suggests that, in some cases, regeneration in 
      plants involves the reprogramming of distinct somatic cells, while in others, it is 
      induced by the activation of relatively undifferentiated cells in somatic tissues. 
      However, this review covers the most important factors involved in the process of 
      plant regeneration and discusses the mechanisms by which plants monitor this 
      process.

      during coconut somatic embryogenesis.

AB  - Genome-wide analysis of small RNAs identifies somatic embryogenesis- specific miRNAs 
      and their targets and provides novel insights into the mechanisms governing somatic 
      embryogenesis in coconut, a highly in vitro recalcitrant species. Coconut, a major 
      plantation crop of the tropics is recalcitrant to in vitro culture with a very low 
      rate of somatic embryo turnover. Clonal propagation to enhance the production of 
      high yielding, disease-free planting material in coconut has remained a distant 
      reality. To better understand the molecular basis of this recalcitrance and to throw 
      light on the complex regulatory network involved in the transition of coconut 
      somatic cells to embryogenic calli, genome-wide profiling of small RNAs from 
      embryogenic (EC) and non-embryogenic calli (NEC) was undertaken using Illumina Hiseq 
      2000 platform. We have identified a total of 110 conserved miRNAs (representing 46 
      known miRNA families) in both types of calli. In addition, 97 novel miRNAs (48 
      specific to EC, 21 specific to NEC and 28 common to both the libraries) were also 
      identified. Among the conserved miRNAs, 10 were found to be differentially expressed 
      between NEC and EC libraries with a log2 fold change > 2 following RPM-based 
      normalization. miR156f, miR167c, miR169a, miR319a, miR535a, and miR5179 are 
      upregulated and miR160a, miR166a, miR171a, and miR319b are down-regulated in NEC. To 
      confirm the differential expression pattern and their regulatory role in SE, the 
      expression patterns of miRNAs and their putative targets were analyzed using qRT- 
      PCR and most of the analyzed miRNA-target pairs showed inverse correlation during 
      somatic embryogenesis. Selected targets were further validated by RNA ligase 
      mediated rapid amplification of 5' cDNA ends (5'RLM-RACE). Our data suggest that a 
      few conserved miRNAs and species-specific miRNAs act in concert to regulate the 
      process of somatic embryogenesis in coconut. The results of this study provide the 
      first overview into the regulatory landscape of somatic embryogenesis in coconut and 
      possible strategies for fine-tuning or reprogramming to enhance somatic embryo turn 
      over in coconut.

LID - 10.3390/ijms21093394 [doi]
LID - 3394
AB  - The effects of auxins 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid), NAA 
      (1-naphthaleneacetic acid) or picloram (4-amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid; 9 µM) 
      and cytokinin BA (benzyloadenine; 4.5 µM) applied in the early stages of somatic 
      embryogenesis (SE) on specific stages of SE in Picea abies and P. omorika were 
      investigated. The highest SE initiation frequency was obtained after 2,4-D 
      application in P. omorika (22.00%) and picloram application in P. abies (10.48%). 
      NAA treatment significantly promoted embryogenic tissue (ET) proliferation in P. 
      abies, while 2,4-D treatment reduced it. This reduction was related to the oxidative 
      stress level, which was lower with the presence of NAA in the proliferation medium 
      and higher with the presence of 2,4-D. The reduced oxidative stress level after NAA 
      treatment suggests that hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) acts as a signalling molecule 
      and promotes ET proliferation. NAA and picloram in the proliferation medium 
      decreased the further production and maturation of P. omorika somatic embryos 
      compared with that under 2,4-D. The quality of the germinated P. abies embryos and 
      their development into plantlets depended on the auxin type and were the highest in 
      NAA-originated embryos. These results show that different auxin types can generate 
      different physiological responses in plant materials during SE in both spruce 
      species.

AB  - During plant embryogenesis, regardless of whether it begins with a fertilized egg 
      cell (zygotic embryogenesis) or an induced somatic cell (somatic embryogenesis), 
      significant epigenetic reprogramming occurs with the purpose of parental or 
      vegetative transcript silencing and establishment of a next-generation epigenetic 
      patterning. To ensure genome stability of a developing embryo, large-scale 
      transposon silencing occurs by an RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway, which 
      introduces methylation patterns de novo and as such potentially serves as a global 
      mechanism of transcription control during developmental transitions. RdDM is 
      controlled by a two-armed mechanism based around the activity of two RNA 
      polymerases. While PolIV produces siRNAs accompanied by protein complexes comprising 
      the methylation machinery, PolV produces lncRNA which guides the methylation 
      machinery toward specific genomic locations. Recently, RdDM has been proposed as a 
      dominant methylation mechanism during gamete formation and early embryo development 
      in Arabidopsis thaliana, overshadowing all other methylation mechanisms. Here, we 
      bring an overview of current knowledge about different roles of DNA methylation with 
      emphasis on RdDM during plant zygotic and somatic embryogenesis. Based on published 
      chromatin immunoprecipitation data on PolV binding sites within the A. thaliana 
      genome, we uncover groups of auxin metabolism, reproductive development and 
      embryogenesis-related genes, and discuss possible roles of RdDM at the onset of 
      early embryonic development via targeted methylation at sites involved in different 
      embryogenesis-related developmental mechanisms.

AB  - Coleus forskohlii syn. Plectranthus barbatus is a popular medicinal plant belonging 
      to the family Lamiaceae and order Lamiales. The leaf and root extracts can be 
      utilized for the treatment of various ailments like bronchitis, asthma, hay fever, 
      angina and abdominal disorders. The major metabolite that is found exclusively in 
      the cork cells of the root in C. forskohlii is forskolin, which is used commercially 
      for the treatment of glaucoma, asthma and several heart ailments. The essential oil 
      extracted from the tubers of the plant also exhibits anti-microbial properties. The 
      present review recounts the existing reports on biotechnological approaches like 
      direct, indirect organogenesis and somatic embryogenesis for mass propagation of 
      plantlets; the amelioration of forskolin production through cell suspension and 
      genetic transformation as well as slow growth storage for germplasm conservation. 
      Additionally, the unexplored arenas and the prospective novel approaches are also 
      addressed in this review that can be utilized in designing new experiments in near 
      future on this plant.

AB  - Somatic embryogenesis (SE) has high potential for large-scale clonal propagation of 
      conifers. Different types of bioreactor cultures have been tested for the conifer SE 
      process where the temporary immersion bioreactors (TIBs) have proved to be useful 
      across the different developmental steps of the SE process. In the present study the 
      use of TIBs was tested for hybrid larch (Larix × eurolepis Henry). The results 
      showed two-fold increases in both fresh weight (FW) of pro-embryogenic masses (PEMs) 
      and yield of cotyledonary embryos in the TIBs compared to solid medium in plates. 
      For the germination phase, the highest number of roots per plant, the root length 
      and height of plants were also obtained in the TIBs. The results show that the TIB 
      system can be successfully used to support scale up of plant production in all steps 
      of the SE process from proliferation to germination of hybrid larch 
      (Larix × eurolepis Henry).

TI  - LEAFY COTYLEDON 2: A Regulatory Factor of Plant Growth and Seed Development.
LID - 10.3390/genes12121896 [doi]
LID - 1896
AB  - Transcription factors are key molecules in the regulation of gene expression in all 
      organisms. The transcription factor LEAFY COTYLEDON 2 (LEC2), which belongs to the 
      DNA-binding protein family, contains a B3 domain. The transcription factor is 
      involved in the regulation of important plant biological processes such as 
      embryogenesis, somatic embryo formation, seed storage protein synthesis, fatty acid 
      metabolism, and other important biological processes. Recent studies have shown that 
      LEC2 regulates the formation of lateral roots and influences the embryonic resetting 
      of the parental vernalization state. The orthologs of LEC2 and their regulatory 
      effects have also been identified in some crops; however, their regulatory mechanism 
      requires further investigation. Here, we summarize the most recent findings 
      concerning the effects of LEC2 on plant growth and seed development. In addition, we 
      discuss the potential molecular mechanisms of the action of the LEC2 gene during 
      plant development.

TI  - Analysis of grapevine's somatic embryogenesis receptor kinase (SERK) gene family: 
      VqSERK3/BAK1 overexpression enhances disease resistance.
LID - 10.1094/PHYTO-04-21-0136-R [doi]
AB  - The SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR KINASE (SERK) gene family has been intensively 
      studied in several plant species. Here we confirmed the existence of five SERK genes 
      in grapevine (Chinese wild grapevine V. quinquangularis) and named them VqSERK1, 
      VqSERK2, VqSERK3, VqSERK4, and VqSERK5. Analysis of the predicted structures of 
      these SERK proteins revealed they include a signal peptide domain, a leucine zipper 
      domain, a Ser-Pro-Pro domain, a single transmembrane domain, different leucine-rich 
      repeats, and an intracellular kinase activity domain. The SERK genes of grapevine 
      showed different gene expression patterns when treated with powdery mildew (Erysiphe 
      necator) and hormones (SA, JA, ABA and ETH). Subcellular localization assays 
      confirmed that VqSERK family proteins localized to the cell membrane. Moreover, we 
      cloned the SERK3/BAK1 gene from the Chinese wild grapevine V. quinquangularis clone 
      'Shang-24'. Heterologous VqSERK3/BAK1 expression in the Arabidopsis bak1-4 mutant 
      lines restored control of cell death, enhanced resistance to powdery mildew, and 
      also strengthened stomatal immunity. Our work may provide the foundation for further 
      studies of SERK genes for pathogen resistance and hormone treatment in grapevine.

TI  - Comparative Study of the Genetic and Biochemical Variability of Polyscias 
      filicifolia (Araliaceae) Regenerants Obtained by Indirect and Direct Somatic 
      Embryogenesis as a Source of Triterpenes.
LID - 10.3390/ijms22115752 [doi]
LID - 5752
AB  - Polyscias filicifolia (Araliaceae) is broadly used in traditional medicine in 
      Southeast Asia due to its antimicrobial, immunomodulating and cytotoxic activities. 
      The main groups of compounds responsible for pharmacological effects are believed to 
      be oleanolic triterpene saponins. However, Polyscias plants demonstrate relatively 
      slow growth in natural conditions, which led to applying a developing sustainable 
      source of plant material via primary (PSE), secondary (DSE) and direct somatic 
      embryogenesis from DSE (TSE). The AFLP and metAFLP genotyping resulted in 1277 
      markers, amplified by a total of 24 pairs of selective primers. Only 3.13% of the 
      markers were polymorphic. The analysis of variance showed that the PSE and TSE 
      regenerants differed only in terms of root number, while the DSE plantlets differed 
      for all studied morphological characteristics. Further, the chemical analysis 
      revealed that oleanolic acid (439.72 µg/g DW), ursolic acid (111.85 µg/g DW) and 
      hederagenin (19.07 µg/g DW) were determined in TSE regenerants. Our results indicate 
      that direct somatic embryogenesis ensures the production of homogeneous plant 
      material, which can serve as a potential source of triterpene compounds. Plants 
      obtained via somatic embryogenesis could also be reintroduced into the natural 
      environment to protect and preserve its biodiversity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) is a traditional crop in arid and 
      semi-arid areas. Its vegetative propagation can be achieved by offshoots, but 
      possible number of offshoots in mother palm trees is limited. Micropropagation is a 
      highly recommended strategy for obtaining date palm elite cultivars using shoot tip 
      and immature inflorescences. In this study, micropropagation procedure using 
      inflorescence explants of Medjool cv. is described. For culture initiation, explants 
      from different spathe lengths were cultivated on Murashige and Skoog medium (MS) 
      supplemented with picloram at 1.0 and 2.0 mg/l combined with 2iP at 0.5 mg/l alone 
      and with both 2iP and BA at 0.25 mg/l for 24 weeks. The obtained direct globular 
      embryos were transferred to maturation media with 0.1 mg/l picloram alone or 
      combined with both 2iP and ABA separately and together for further development. 
      Additionally, multiplication and rooting media were optimized by different 
      cytokinins and auxins for high frequency of plantlet production. Acclimatization of 
      in vitro plantlets was also investigated. RESULTS: The highest percentage of 
      globular embryo formation was noticed with explants isolated from spathe lengths 
      ranging from 10 to 15 cm. Addition of BA to initiation media with picloram 
      encouraged a significant effect on embryonic culture formation percentage. 
      Incorporation of ABA and 2iP to maturation medium was an effective factor for 
      individual or multiple embryo emergence. Acclimatization of in vitro plantlets 
      having 3-4 roots was successfully accomplished. Irrigation with the full strength 
      solution (MS) encouraged the highest growth vigor degree, leaf number/plant, leaf 
      width, root number, and root thickness degree of ex vitro plants. CONCLUSION: This 
      research provides an advanced regeneration system for large-scale production of date 
      palm from immature inflorescences of Medjool cv. It opens up the prospects of using 
      picloram with different growth regulators for rapid micropropagation of date palm.

TI  - Histology, histochemistry and ultrastructure of pre-embryogenic cells determined for 
      direct somatic embryogenesis in the palm tree Syagrus oleracea.
PG  - 845-875
LID - 10.1111/ppl.13026 [doi]
AB  - Somatic embryogenesis in palm trees is, in general, a slow and highly complex 
      process, with a predominance of the indirect route and, consequently, a lack of 
      knowledge about the direct route. We present new knowledge related to the 
      morphological, histochemical and ultrastructural aspects of the transition from 
      somatic to embryogenic cells and direct formation of somatic embryos from mature 
      zygotic embryos of Syagrus oleracea, a palm tree. The results support the general 
      concept that 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid plays a critical role for the formation 
      of somatic embryos of direct and multicellular origin. Seven days in medium with 
      auxin were enough for the identification of embryogenic cells. These cells had a set 
      of characteristics corresponding to totipotent stem cells. At 14 days on induction 
      medium, nodular formations were observed in the distal region of inoculated embryos, 
      which evolved into globular somatic embryos. At 120 days on induction medium, the 
      quality of the somatic embryos was compromised. The dynamics of the mobilization of 
      reserve compounds was also demonstrated, with emphasis on starch and protein as 
      energy sources required for the embryogenic process. This study shows for the first 
      time the anatomical and ultrastructural events involved in direct somatic 
      embryogenesis in a palm tree and incites the scientific community to return to the 
      discussion of classical concepts related to direct somatic embryogenesis, especially 
      regarding the characteristics and location of determined pre-embryogenic cells.

TI  - Global 5-methylcytosine and physiological changes are triggers of indirect somatic 
      embryogenesis in Coffea canephora.
PG  - 45-57
LID - 10.1007/s00709-020-01551-8 [doi]
AB  - Indirect somatic embryogenesis (ISE) establishment for Coffea species started in the 
      1970s. Since then, intraspecific variations in the morphogenic pathway have been 
      reported, even in the common environmental condition in vitro. Several authors have 
      suggested that these variations are the result of genetic, epigenetic, and/or 
      physiological events, highlighting the need for investigations to know the causes. 
      Along these lines, this study aimed to investigate and describe, for the first time, 
      the global 5-methylcytosine and physiological changes that occur in the cells of the 
      aggregate suspensions of Coffea canephora during proliferation and somatic embryo 
      regeneration steps. The cell proliferation step was characterized by increase in 
      cell mass in all subcultures; relatively low mean values of global 5-methylcytosine 
      (5-mC%), abscisic acid (ABA), and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA); high mean value of 
      1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC, an ethylene precursor); and increase 
      followed by decrease in spermidine (Spd, a polyamine) level. Therefore, these 
      epigenetic and physiologic aspects promoted the cell proliferation, which is 
      fundamental for ISE. In turn, the somatic embryo regeneration was correlated with 
      global 5-mC% and physiological changes. The competence acquisition, determination, 
      and cell differentiation steps were marked by increases in mean values of 5-mC%, IAA 
      and ABA, and decreases in ACC and Spd, evincing that these changes are the triggers 
      for regeneration and maturation of somatic embryos. Therefore, dynamic and 
      coordinated epigenetic and physiologic changes occur in the cells of the aggregate 
      suspensions during the C. canephora ISE in liquid system.

TI  - Optimizing the Protein Fluorescence Reporting System for Somatic Embryogenesis 
      Regeneration Screening and Visual Labeling of Functional Genes in Cotton.

AB  - Protein fluorescence reporting systems are of crucial importance to in-depth life 
      science research, providing systematic labeling tools for visualization of 
      microscopic biological activities in vivo and revolutionizing basic research. Cotton 
      somatic cell regeneration efficiency is low, causing difficulty in cotton 
      transformation. It is conducive to screening transgenic somatic embryo using the 
      fluorescence reporting system. However, available fluorescence labeling systems in 
      cotton are currently limited. To optimize the fluorescence reporting system of 
      cotton with an expanded range of available fluorescent proteins, we selected 11 
      fluorescent proteins covering red, green, yellow, and cyan fluorescence colors and 
      expressed them in cotton. Besides mRuby2 and G3GFP, the other nine fluorescent 
      proteins (mCherry, tdTomato, sfGFP, Clover, EYFP, YPet, mVenus, mCerulean, and ECFP) 
      were stably and intensely expressed in transgenic callus and embryo, and inherited 
      in different cotton organs derive from the screened embryo. In addition, transgenic 
      cotton expressing tdTomato appears pink under white light, not only for callus and 
      embryo tissues but also various organs of mature plants, providing a visual marker 
      in the cotton genetic transformation process, accelerating the evaluation of 
      transgenic events. Further, we constructed transgenic cotton expressing 
      mCherry-labeled organelle markers in vivo that cover seven specific subcellular 
      compartments: plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, tonoplast, mitochondrion, 
      plastid, Golgi apparatus, and peroxisome. We also provide a simple and highly 
      efficient strategy to quickly determine the subcellular localization of 
      uncharacterized proteins in cotton cells using organelle markers. Lastly, we built 
      the first cotton stomatal fluorescence reporting system using stomata-specific 
      expression promoters (ProKST1, ProGbSLSP, and ProGC1) to drive Clover expression. 
      The optimized fluorescence labeling system for transgenic somatic embryo screening 
      and functional gene labeling in this study offers the potential to accelerating 
      somatic cell regeneration efficiency and the in vivo monitoring of diverse cellular 
      processes in cotton.

TI  - Transcriptomic and physiological analysis identifies a gene network module highly

AB  - Somatic embryogenesis is a preferred method for large-scale production of forest 
      trees due to its high propagation efficiency. In this study, hybrid sweetgum leaves 
      with phase changes from mature to embryogenic state were selected as experimental 
      material to study somatic embryo initiation. Embryogenicity ranged from high to low, 
      i.e. from 45%, 25%, and 12.5% to 0, with the samples of embryogenic callus (EC), 
      whiten leaf edge (WLI), whiten leaf (WLII), and green leaf (GL) respectively. High 
      correlations existed between embryogenicity and endogenous brassinosteroids (BRs) 
      (r = 0.95, p < 0.05). Similarly, concentrations of endogenous BRs of the sample set 
      correlated positively (r = 0.93, 0.99, 0.87, 0.99, 0.96 respectively, P < 0.05) to 
      expression of somatic embryo (SE)-related genes, i.e. BBM, LEC2, ABI3, PLT2, and 
      WOX2. Hierarchical cluster and weighted gene coexpression network analysis 
      identified modules of coexpressed genes and network in 4820 differentially expressed 
      genes (DEGs) from All-BR-Regulated Genes (ABRG). Moreover, exogenously-supplemented 
      epiBR, together with 2,4-D and 6-BA, increased embryogenicity of GL-sourced callus, 
      and expression of SE- and auxin-related genes, while brassinazole (BRZ), a BR 
      biosynthesis inhibitor, reduced embryogenicity. Evidences obtained in this study 
      revealed that BRs involved in phase change of leaf explants and may function in 
      regulating gene expression and enhancing auxin effects. This study successfully 
      established protocols for inducing somatic embryogenesis from leaf explants in 
      hybrid sweetgum, which could facilitate the propagation process greatly, and provide 
      theoretical basis for manipulating SE competence of explants in ornamental woody 
      plants.

AB  - Somatic embryogenesis is an important biotechnological technique for large-scale 
      propagation of elite genotypes. Identifying stage-specific compounds associated with 
      somatic embryo development can help elucidate the ontogenesis of Carica papaya L. 
      somatic embryos and improve tissue culture protocols. To identify the stage-specific 
      proteins that are present during the differentiation of C. papaya somatic embryos, 
      proteomic analyses of embryos at the globular, heart, torpedo and cotyledonary 
      developmental stages were performed. Mass spectrometry data have been deposited in 
      the ProteomeXchange with the dataset identifier PXD021107. Comparative proteomic 
      analyses revealed a total of 801 proteins, with 392 classified as differentially 
      accumulated proteins in at least one of the developmental stages. The 
      globular-staged presented a higher number of unique proteins (16), and 7 were 
      isoforms of 60S ribosomal proteins, suggesting high translational activity at the 
      beginning of somatic embryogenesis. Proteins related to mitochondrial metabolism 
      accumulated to a high degree at the early developmental stages and then decreased 
      with increasing development, and they contributed to cell homeostasis in early 
      somatic embryos. A progressive increase in the accumulation of vicilin, late 
      embryogenesis abundant proteins and chloroplastic proteins that lead to somatic 
      embryo maturation was also observed. The differential accumulation of 
      acetylornithine deacetylase and S-adenosylmethionine synthase 2 proteins was 
      correlated with increases in putrescine and spermidine contents, which suggests that 
      both polyamines should be tested to determine whether they increase the conversion 
      rates of globular- to cotyledonary-staged somatic embryos. Taken together, the 
      results showed that somatic embryo development in C. papaya is regulated by the 
      differential accumulation of proteins, with ribosomal and mitochondrial proteins 
      more abundant during the early somatic embryo stages and seed maturation proteins 
      more abundant during the late stages.

TI  - Citrus Polyamines: Structure, Biosynthesis, and Physiological Functions.
LID - 10.3390/plants9040426 [doi]
LID - 426
AB  - Polyamines (PAs) are ubiquitous biogenic amines found in all living organisms from 
      bacteria to Archaea, and Eukaryotes including plants and animals. Since the first 
      description of putrescine conjugate, feruloyl-putrescine (originally called 
      subaphylline), from grapefruit leaves and juice, many research studies have 
      highlighted the importance of PAs in growth, development, and other physiological 
      processes in citrus plants. PAs appear to be involved in a wide range of 
      physiological processes in citrus plants; however, their exact roles are not fully 
      understood. Accordingly, in the present review, we discuss the biosynthesis of PAs 
      in citrus plants, with an emphasis on the recent advances in identifying and 
      characterizing PAs-biosynthetic genes and other upstream regulatory genes involved 
      in transcriptional regulation of PAs metabolism. In addition, we will discuss the 
      recent metabolic, genetic, and molecular evidence illustrating the roles of PAs 
      metabolism in citrus physiology including somatic embryogenesis; root system 
      formation, morphology, and architecture; plant growth and shoot system architecture; 
      inflorescence, flowering, and flowering-associated events; fruit set, development, 
      and quality; stomatal closure and gas-exchange; and chlorophyll fluorescence and 
      photosynthesis. We believe that the molecular and biochemical understanding of PAs 
      metabolism and their physiological roles in citrus plants will help citrus breeding 
      programs to enhance tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses and provide bases for 
      further research into potential applications.

TI  - Induction of Radiata Pine Somatic Embryogenesis at High Temperatures Provokes a 
      Long-Term Decrease in DNA Methylation/Hydroxymethylation and Differential Expression 
      of Stress-Related Genes.
LID - 10.3390/plants9121762 [doi]
LID - 1762
AB  - Based on the hypothesis that embryo development is a crucial stage for the formation 
      of stable epigenetic marks that could modulate the behaviour of the resulting 
      plants, in this study, radiata pine somatic embryogenesis was induced at high 
      temperatures (23 °C, eight weeks, control; 40 °C, 4 h; 60 °C, 5 min) and the global 
      methylation and hydroxymethylation levels of emerging embryonal masses and somatic 
      plants were analysed using LC-ESI-MS/ MS-MRM. In this context, the expression 
      pattern of six genes previously described as stress-mediators was studied throughout 
      the embryogenic process until plant level to assess whether the observed epigenetic 
      changes could have provoked a sustained alteration of the transcriptome. Results 
      indicated that the highest temperatures led to hypomethylation of both embryonal 
      masses and somatic plants. Moreover, we detected for the first time in a pine 
      species the presence of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, and revealed its tissue specificity 
      and potential involvement in heat-stress responses. Additionally, a heat shock 
      protein-coding gene showed a down-regulation tendency along the process, with a 
      special emphasis given to embryonal masses at first subculture and ex vitro somatic 
      plants. Likewise, the transcripts of several proteins related with translation, 
      oxidative stress response, and drought resilience were differentially expressed.

AB  - The differential expression of genes is crucial for plant somatic embryogenesis 
      (SE), and the accurate quantification of gene expression levels relies on choosing 
      appropriate reference genes. To select the most suitable reference genes for SE 
      studies, 10 commonly used reference genes were examined in synchronized somatic 
      embryogenic and subsequent germinative cultures of Liriodendron hybrids by using 
      quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR. Four popular normalization 
      algorithms: geNorm, NormFinder, Bestkeeper and Delta-Ct were used to select and 
      validate the suitable reference genes. The results showed that elongation factor 
      1-gamma, histone H1 linker protein, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and 
      α-tubulin were suitable for SE tissues, while elongation factor 1-gamma and actin 
      were best for the germinative organ tissues. Our work will benefit future studies of 
      gene expression and functional analyses of SE in Liriodendron hybrids. It is also 
      serves as a guide of reference gene selection in early embryonic gene expression 
      analyses for other woody plant species.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Somatic embryogenesis (SE) is a promising technology for plant 
      vegetative propagation, which has an important role in tree breeding. Though rubber 
      tree (Hevea brasiliensis Muell. Arg.) SE has been founded, few late SE-related genes 
      have been identified and the molecular regulation mechanisms of late SE are still 
      not well understood. RESULTS: In this study, the transcriptomes of embryogenic 
      callus (EC), primary embryo (PE), cotyledonary embryo (CE), abnormal embryo (AE), 
      mature cotyledonary embryo (MCE) and withered abnormal embryo (WAE) were analyzed. A 
      total of 887,852,416 clean reads were generated, 85.92% of them were mapped to the 
      rubber tree genome. The de novo assembly generated 36,937 unigenes. The 
      differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the pairwise comparisons of 
      CE vs. AE and MCE vs. WAE, respectively. The specific common DEGs were mainly 
      involved in the phytohormones signaling pathway, biosynthesis of phenylpropanoid and 
      starch and sucrose metabolism. Among them, hormone signal transduction related genes 
      were significantly enriched, especially the auxin signaling factors (AUX-like1, 
      GH3.1, SAUR32-like, IAA9-like, IAA14-like, IAA27-like, IAA28-like and ARF5-like). 
      The transcription factors including WRKY40, WRKY70, MYBS3-like, MYB1R1-like, AIL6 
      and bHLH93-like were characterized as molecular markers for rubber tree late SE. 
      CML13, CML36, CAM-7, SERK1 and LEAD-29-like were also related to rubber tree late 
      SE. In addition, histone modification had crucial roles during rubber tree late SE. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study provides important information to elucidate the molecular 
      regulation during rubber tree late SE.

TI  - Maturation and Conversion of Somatic Embryos Derived from Seeds of Olive (Olea 
      europaea L.) cv. Dahbia: Occurrence of Secondary Embryogenesis and Adventitious Bud 
      Formation.

AB  - Maturation and conversion of somatic embryos are two crucial steps that hamper the 
      development of efficient somatic embryogenesis systems in olive. Herein, a simple 
      and efficient protocol for the maturation and conversion of olive somatic embryos is 
      reported. Globular somatic embryos derived from seeds of cv. Dahbia were cultured on 
      either half-strength olive (OM) or olive cyclic embryogenesis (ECO) media, with and 
      without plant growth regulators (PGRs). The embryos reached the cotyledonary stage 
      in 9 weeks, but those cultured on ECO medium containing 0.1 mg·L(-1) 
      6-(dimethylallylamino)purine (2iP), 0.1 mg·L(-1) 6-benzyladenine (BA) and 0.05 
      mg·L(-1) indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) exhibited the largest sizes, with an average of 
      4.7 mm. Somatic embryo conversion into plantlets was evaluated using different 
      culture media (half-strength OM or one-third strength Murashige and Skoog (MS)), 
      light conditions (light or dark) and desiccation pretreatments. The highest rate of 
      somatic embryo conversion (45%) was observed under a 16 h photoperiod on half 
      strength OM medium containing 0.1 mg·L(-1) gibberellic acid (GA(3)) and 0.1 mg·L(-1) 
      1-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA). The embryos that failed to germinate showed either 
      necrosis, cotyledon greening with no further conversion, adventitious bud formation 
      or secondary embryogenesis. The findings of this study will be beneficial for 
      biotechnological applications in olive.

AB  - To establish an efficient plant regeneration system from cell suspension cultures of 
      Euonymus alatus, embryogenic callus formation from immature embryos was 
      investigated. The highest frequency of embryogenic callus formation reached 50% when 
      the immature zygotic embryos were incubated on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium 
      supplemented with 1 mg/L 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid (2,4-D). At higher 
      concentrations of 2,4-D (over 2 mg/L), the frequency of embryogenic callus formation 
      declined significantly. The total number of somatic embryos development was highest 
      with the 3% (w/v) sucrose treatment, which was found to be the optimal concentration 
      for somatic embryo formation. Activated charcoal (AC) and 6-benzyladenine (BA) 
      significantly increased the frequency of plantlet conversion from somatic embryos, 
      but gibberellic acid (GA(3)) had a negative effect on plantlet conversion and 
      subsequent development from somatic embryos. Even though the cell suspension 
      cultures were maintained for more than 1 year, cell aggregates from embryogenic cell 
      suspension cultures were successfully converted into normal somatic embryos with two 
      cotyledons. To our knowledge, this is the first successful report of a plant 
      regeneration system of E. alatus via somatic embryogenesis. Thus, the embryogenic 
      cell line and plant regeneration system established in this study can be applied to 
      mass proliferation and production of pharmaceutical metabolite in E. alatus.

AB  - Generation of plant lines with transgene or edited gene variants is the desired 
      outcome of transformation technology. Conventional DNA-based plant transformation 
      methods are the most commonly used technology but these approaches are limited to a 
      small number of plant species with efficient transformation systems. The ideal 
      transformation technologies are those that allow biotechnology applications across 
      wide genetic background, especially within elite germplasm of major crop species. 
      This chapter will briefly review key regulatory genes involved in plant 
      morphogenesis with a focus on in vitro somatic embryogenesis and their application 
      in improving plant transformation.

PG  - 490-508
LID - 10.1093/plphys/kiab477 [doi]
AB  - Somatic embryogenesis (SE) represents the most appropriate tool for next-generation 
      breeding methods in woody plants such as grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.). However, in 
      this species, the SE competence is strongly genotype-dependent and the molecular 
      basis of this phenomenon is poorly understood. We explored the genetic and 
      epigenetic basis of SE in grapevine by profiling the transcriptome, epigenome, and 
      small RNAome of undifferentiated, embryogenic, and non-embryogenic callus tissues 
      derived from two genotypes differing in competence for SE, Sangiovese and Cabernet 
      Sauvignon. During the successful formation of embryonic callus, we observed the 
      upregulation of epigenetic-related transcripts and short interfering RNAs in 
      association with DNA hypermethylation at transposable elements in both varieties. 
      Nevertheless, the switch to nonembryonic development matched the incomplete 
      reinforcement of transposon silencing, and the evidence of such effect was more 
      apparent in the recalcitrant Cabernet Sauvignon. Transcriptomic differences between 
      the two genotypes were maximized already at early stage of culture where the 
      recalcitrant variety expressed a broad panel of genes related to stress responses 
      and secondary metabolism. Our data provide a different angle on the SE molecular 
      dynamics that can be exploited to leverage SE as a biotechnological tool for fruit 
      crop breeding.

LID - 10.1007/s00253-020-10592-1 [doi]
AB  - Catharanthus roseus (L.) G. Don, also known as Madagascar periwinkle or Sadabahar, 
      is a herbaceous plant belonging to the family Apocynaceae. Being a reservoir for 
      more than 200 alkaloids, it reserves a place for itself in the list of important 
      medicinal plants. Secondary metabolites are present in its leaves (e.g., vindoline, 
      vinblastine, catharanthine, and vincristine) as well as basal stem and roots (e.g., 
      ajmalicine, reserpine, serpentine, horhammericine, tabersonine, leurosine, 
      catharanthine, lochnerine, and vindoline). Two of its alkaloids, vincristine and 
      vinblastine (possessing anticancerous properties), are being used copiously in 
      pharmaceutical industries. Till date, arrays of reports are available on in vitro 
      biotechnological improvements of C. roseus. The present review article concentrates 
      chiefly on various biotechnological advancements based on plant tissue culture 
      techniques of the last three decades, for instance, regeneration via direct and 
      indirect organogenesis, somatic embryogenesis, secondary metabolite production, 
      synthetic seed production, clonal fidelity assessment, polyploidization, genetic 
      transformation, and nanotechnology. It also portrays the importance of various 
      factors influencing the success of in vitro biotechnological interventions in 
      Catharanthus and further addresses several shortcomings that can be further explored 
      to create a platform for upcoming innovative approaches. KEY POINTS: • C. roseus 
      yields anticancerous vincristine and vinblastine used in pharma industry. •In vitro 
      biotechnological interventions prompted major genetic advancements. • This review 
      provides an insight on in vitro-based research achievements till date. • Key 
      bottlenecks and prospective research methodologies have been identified herein.

TI  - The SAUR gene family in coffee: genome-wide identification and gene expression 
      analysis during somatic embryogenesis.
LID - 10.1007/s11033-021-07011-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Small auxin-up RNA (SAUR) genes form a wide family supposedly involved 
      in different physiological and developmental processes in plants such as leaf 
      senescence, auxin signaling and transport, hypocotyl development and tolerance to 
      abiotic stresses. The transcription of SAUR genes is quickly induced by auxins, a 
      group of phytohormones of major importance on embryo development. To better 
      understand the distribution and expression profile of such still not explored family 
      in Coffea sp., especially during the development of somatic embryogenesis (SE), SAUR 
      members were characterized in silico using the available Coffea canephora genome 
      data and analyzed for gene expression by RT-qPCR in C. arabica embryogenic samples. 
      METHODS AND RESULTS: Over C. canephora genome 31 CcSAURs were distributed by 11 
      chromosomes. Out of these 31 gene members, 5 SAURs were selected for gene expression 
      analysis in C. arabica embryogenic materials. CaSAUR12 and CaSAUR18 were the members 
      highly expressed through almost all plant materials. The other genes had more 
      expression in at least one of the developing embryo stages or plantlets. The 
      CaSAUR12 was the only member to exhibit an increased expression in both 
      non-embryogenic calli and the developing embryo stages. CONCLUSION: The 
      identification of SAUR family on C. canephora genome followed by the analysis of 
      gene expression profile across coffee somatic embryogenesis process on C. arabica 
      represents a further additional step towards a better comprehension of molecular 
      components acting on SE. Along with new research about this gene family such 
      knowledge may support studies about clonal propagation methods via somatic 
      embryogenesis to help the scientific community towards improvements into coffee 
      crop.

AB  - Cryptomeria japonica D. Don (common name is Sugi or Japanese cedar) is the most 
      important forestation tree species in Japan, and 2nd generation plus trees with 
      superior traits have been selected by breeding projects. Biotechnological approaches 
      such as genetic transformation and genome editing are expected to accelerate to add 
      useful traits (e.g., no-pollen traits) to superior trees in short time. To develop a 
      platform for genetic transformation and genome editing of C. japonica superior 
      trees, this study investigated the embryogenic potential of 2nd generation plus 
      trees and obtained good cell lines with high embryogenic potential, which could be 
      useful material for adding new and useful traits to superior trees by genetic 
      transformation. However, the maintenance of embryogenic cell lines is laborious, and 
      prolonged subculture leads to a loss of embryogenesis potential. Therefore, cell 
      lines need to be cryopreserved for long without subculture. Therefore, in this study 
      we made a simple cryopreservation protocol suitable for most C. japonica cell lines. 
      We showed that cryopreserved cells using this protocol formed somatic embryos, which 
      were then converted to plantlets. Transgenic cells produced from cryopreserved cells 
      expressed transgene, gfp. These results indicated that our cryopreservation protocol 
      can be used for prolonged storage of genetic transformation target materials in C. 
      japonica.

TI  - From Single Cell to Plants: Mesophyll Protoplasts as a Versatile System for 
      Investigating Plant Cell Reprogramming.
LID - 10.3390/ijms21124195 [doi]
LID - 4195
AB  - Plants are sessile organisms that have a remarkable developmental plasticity, which 
      ensures their optimal adaptation to environmental stresses. Plant cell totipotency 
      is an extreme example of such plasticity, whereby somatic cells have the potential 
      to form plants via direct shoot organogenesis or somatic embryogenesis in response 
      to various exogenous and/or endogenous signals. Protoplasts provide one of the most 
      suitable systems for investigating molecular mechanisms of totipotency, because they 
      are effectively single cell populations. In this review, we consider the current 
      state of knowledge of the mechanisms that induce cell proliferation from individual, 
      differentiated somatic plant cells. We highlight initial explant metabolic status, 
      ploidy level and isolation procedure as determinants of successful cell 
      reprogramming. We also discuss the importance of auxin signalling and its 
      interaction with stress-regulated pathways in governing cell cycle induction and 
      further stages of plant cell totipotency.

TI  - Dynamic Transcriptome Analysis Reveals Uncharacterized Complex Regulatory Pathway 
      Underlying Genotype-Recalcitrant Somatic Embryogenesis Transdifferentiation in 
      Cotton.
LID - 10.3390/genes11050519 [doi]

AB  - As a notable illustration of totipotency and plant regeneration, somatic 
      embryogenesis (SE) is the developmental reprogramming of somatic cells toward the 
      embryogenesis pathway, the key step for genetic engineering. Investigations 
      examining the totipotency process are of great fundamental and practical importance 
      in crop biotechnology. However, high-frequency regeneration of cotton via SE has 
      been limited due to genotype-dependent response. The molecular basis deciphering SE 
      genotype recalcitrance remains largely unexplored in cotton. In the current study, 
      to comprehensively investigate the dynamic transcriptional profiling and gene 
      regulatory patterns involved in SE process, a genome-wide RNA sequencing analysis 
      was performed in two cotton genotypes with distinct embryogenic abilities, the 
      highly embryogenic genotype Yuzao 1 (YZ) and the recalcitrant genotype Lumian 1 
      (LM). Three typical developmental staged cultures of early SE-hypocotyls (HY), 
      nonembryogenic calli (NEC) and primary embryogenic calli (PEC)-were selected to 
      establish the transcriptional profiles. Our data revealed that a total of 62,562 
      transcripts were present amongst different developmental stages in the two 
      genotypes. Of these, 18,394 and 26,514 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were 
      identified during callus dedifferentiation (NEC-VS-HY) and embryogenic 
      transdifferentiation (PEC-VS-NEC), respectively in the recalcitrant genotype, 21,842 
      and 22,343 DEGs in the highly embryogenic genotype. Furthermore, DEGs were clustered 
      into six expression patterns during cotton SE process in the two genotypes. 
      Moreover, functional enrichment analysis revealed that DEGs were significantly 
      enriched in fatty acid, tryptophan and pyruvate metabolism in the highly embryogenic 
      genotype and in DNA conformation change otherwise in the recalcitrant genotype. In 
      addition, critical SE-associated expressed transcription factors, as well as 
      alternative splicing events, were notably and preferentially activated during 
      embryogenic transdifferentiation in the highly embryogenic genotype compared with 
      the recalcitrant genotype. Taken together, by systematically comparing two genotypes 
      with distinct embryogenic abilities, the findings in our study revealed a 
      comprehensive overview of the dynamic gene regulatory patterns and uncharacterized 
      complex regulatory pathways during cotton SE genotype-dependent response. Our work 
      provides insights into the molecular basis and important gene resources for 
      understanding the underlying genotype recalcitrance during SE process and plant 
      regeneration, thereby holding great promise for accelerating the application of 
      biotechnology to cotton for improving its breeding efficiency.

TI  - Salinity tolerance in barley during germination- homologs and potential genes.
PG  - 93-121
LID - 10.1631/jzus.B1900400 [doi]
AB  - Salinity affects more than 6% of the world's total land area, causing massive losses 
      in crop yield. Salinity inhibits plant growth and development through osmotic and 
      ionic stresses; however, some plants exhibit adaptations through osmotic regulation, 
      exclusion, and translocation of accumulated Na+ or Cl-. Currently, there are no 
      practical, economically viable methods for managing salinity, so the best practice 
      is to grow crops with improved tolerance. Germination is the stage in a plant's life 
      cycle most adversely affected by salinity. Barley, the fourth most important cereal 
      crop in the world, has outstanding salinity tolerance, relative to other cereal 
      crops. Here, we review the genetics of salinity tolerance in barley during 
      germination by summarizing reported quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and functional 
      genes. The homologs of candidate genes for salinity tolerance in Arabidopsis, 
      soybean, maize, wheat, and rice have been blasted and mapped on the barley reference 
      genome. The genetic diversity of three reported functional gene families for salt 
      tolerance during barley germination, namely dehydration-responsive element-binding 
      (DREB) protein, somatic embryogenesis receptor-like kinase and aquaporin genes, is 
      discussed. While all three gene families show great diversity in most plant species, 
      the DREB gene family is more diverse in barley than in wheat and rice. Further to 
      this review, a convenient method for screening for salinity tolerance at germination 
      is needed, and the mechanisms of action of the genes involved in salt tolerance need 
      to be identified, validated, and transferred to commercial cultivars for field 
      production in saline soil.

TI  - Functional characterization of a WRKY family gene involved in somatic embryogenesis 
      in Panax ginseng.
PG  - 449-458

AB  - As a perennial herbaceous species, Panax ginseng is widely cultivated and used as 
      traditional herbal medicine. The root of Panax ginseng commonly remains expensive as 
      conventional breeding of Panax ginseng is difficult. Somatic embryogenesis (S.E.) is 
      a useful tool for plant propagation and optimal model for understanding the 
      mechanisms of plant embryogenesis. In Panax ginseng, increasing studies have been 
      widely performed to optimize the technology of S.E., while the underlying mechanism 
      remains unclear. In this paper, we cloned and identified a WRKY family gene named 
      PgWRKY6 which is upregulated in response to 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic 
      acid)-induced embryogenic callus development. The silencing of PgWRKY6 obviously 
      reduces the induction rate of embryogenic callus, indicating its crucial role in 
      S.E. of Panax ginseng hairy root. The expressions of several ROS-scavenging genes 
      are also inducible during embryogenic callus development, and the transcriptions of 
      PgGST, PgAPX1, and PgSOD are demonstrated to be regulated by PgWRKY6. Recombinant 
      PgWRKY6, an approximate 40-KDa protein purified from Escherichia coli, shows a 
      specific DNA-binding activity with a potential recognition site of TTGAC(C/T). This 
      work demonstrated that as a conserved WRKY family transcription factor, PgWRKY6 
      functions upstream of PgGST, PgAPX1, and PgSOD, and potentially mediated auxins -ROS 
      signaling pathway in the process of S.E. in Panax species.

AB  - Late Embryogenesis Abundant (LEA) proteins are commonly found in plants and other 
      organisms capable of undergoing severe and reversible dehydration, a phenomenon 
      termed "anhydrobiosis". Here, we have produced a tagged version for three different 
      LEA proteins: pTag-RAB17-GFP-N, Zea mays dehydrin-1dhn, expressed in the 
      nucleo-cytoplasm; pTag-WCOR410-RFP, Tricum aestivum cold acclimation protein 
      WCOR410, binds to cellular membranes, and pTag-LEA-BFP, Artemia franciscana LEA 
      protein group 3 that targets the mitochondria. Sheep fibroblasts transfected with 
      single or all three LEA proteins were subjected to air drying under controlled 
      conditions. After rehydration, cell viability and functionality of the 
      membrane/mitochondria were assessed. After 4 h of air drying, cells from the 
      un-transfected control group were almost completely nonviable (1% cell alive), while 
      cells expressing LEA proteins showed high viability (more than 30%), with the 
      highest viability (58%) observed in fibroblasts expressing all three LEA proteins. 
      Growth rate was markedly compromised in control cells, while LEA-expressing cells 
      proliferated at a rate comparable to non-air-dried cells. Plasmalemma, cytoskeleton 
      and mitochondria appeared unaffected in LEA-expressing cells, confirming the 
      protection conferred by LEA proteins on these organelles during dehydration stress. 
      This is likely to be an effective strategy when aiming to confer desiccation 
      tolerance to mammalian cells.

TI  - SERK genes identification and expression analysis during somatic embryogenesis and 
      sporogenesis of sexual and apomictic Brachiaria brizantha (Syn. Urochloa brizantha).
PG  - 39
LID - 10.1007/s00425-020-03443-w [doi]
AB  - In Brachiaria brizantha BbrizSERK1, BbrizSERK2 and BbrizSERK3 were identified. SERK 
      expression marks somatic embryogenesis, sexual MMC, and sexual and apomictic PMC. 
      BbrizSERK3 might have a regulatory role in reproductive development. Somatic 
      embryogenesis receptor-like kinase (SERK) consists of plasma membrane receptor genes 
      that have been characterized in various species, associated with several aspects of 
      plant development, including reproduction. SERK genes are involved in anther 
      development and in early embryo development in sexual and asexual seed formation. To 
      comprehend the complexity of the SERK genes and their function in Brachiaria 
      reproduction, we performed a homology-based search in a genomic database of a sexual 
      B. brizantha and identified sequences of three SERK genes, BbrizSERK1, BbrizSERK2, 
      and BbrizSERK3. RNASeq data showed equivalent abundance of BbrizSERK1 and BbrizSERK2 
      transcripts in ovaries at early megasporogenesis of sexuals and apomicts, while 
      BbrizSERK3 transcripts were more abundant in ovaries of sexuals than in apomicts. 
      BbrizSERK3 results in three coding sequences due to alternative splicing, among them 
      Variant 1 results in a protein with all the predicted domains of a SERK. BbrizSERK 
      transcripts were detected in male reproductive tissues of both sexual and apomictic 
      plants, suggesting a role in controlling anther development. BbrizSERK transcripts 
      were detected early in ovule development, in the integuments, and in the megaspore 
      mother cell of the sexual plant, but not in the cells that give rise to apomictic 
      embryo sacs, suggesting a role in female reproductive development of sexuals. This 
      paper provides evidences that SERK genes plays a role in the onset and establishment 
      of somatic embryogenesis and in the reproductive development of B. brizantha and 
      suggests a distinct role of BbrizSERK in apomixis initiation.

LID - 1037
AB  - Brachypodium distachyon has become an excellent model for plant breeding and 
      bioenergy grasses that permits many fundamental questions in grass biology to be 
      addressed. One of the constraints to performing research in many grasses has been 
      the difficulty with which they can be genetically transformed and the generally low 
      frequency of such transformations. In this review, we discuss the contribution that 
      transformation techniques have made in Brachypodium biology as well as how 
      Brachypodium could be used to determine the factors that might contribute to 
      transformation efficiency. In particular, we highlight the latest research on the 
      mechanisms that govern the gradual loss of embryogenic potential in a tissue culture 
      and propose using B. distachyon as a model for other recalcitrant monocots.

      Prospects.

AB  - Olive (Olea europaea L.) is the most characteristic and important oil crop of the 
      Mediterranean region. Traditional olive cultivation is based on few tens cultivars 
      of ancient origin. To improve this crop, novel selections with higher tolerance to 
      biotic and abiotic stress, adaptable to high-density planting systems and resilient 
      to climate change are needed; however, breeding programs are hindered by the long 
      juvenile period of this species and few improved genotypes have been released so 
      far. Genetic transformation could be of great value, in the near future, to develop 
      new varieties or rootstocks in a shorter time; in addition, it has currently become 
      an essential tool for functional genomic studies. The recalcitrance of olive tissues 
      to their in vitro manipulation has been the main bottleneck in the development of 
      genetic transformation procedures in this species; however, some important traits 
      such as fungal resistance, flowering or lipid composition have successfully been 
      manipulated through the genetic transformation of somatic embryos of juvenile or 
      adult origin, providing a proof of the potential role that this technology could 
      have in olive improvement. However, the optimization of these protocols for explants 
      of adult origin is a prerequisite to obtain useful materials for the olive industry. 
      In this review, initially, factors affecting plant regeneration via somatic 
      embryogenesis are discussed. Subsequently, the different transformation approaches 
      explored in olive are reviewed. Finally, transgenic experiments with genes of 
      interest undertaken to manipulate selected traits are discussed.

TI  - Roles of the wound hormone jasmonate in plant regeneration.
LID - erab508 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jxb/erab508 [doi]
AB  - Plants have remarkable abilities to regenerate in response to wounding. How wounding 
      triggers rapid signal transduction to induce a cellular response is a key topic for 
      understanding the molecular mechanism of plant regeneration. An increasing body of 
      evidence indicates that jasmonate, a hormone that is produced rapidly in response to 
      wounding, plays multiple roles in different plant regeneration processes. In this 
      review, we summarize recent advances on the roles of jasmonate in tissue repair, the 
      formation of wound-induced callus, de novo organ regeneration, and somatic 
      embryogenesis. Physiological and molecular analyses indicate that jasmonate can 
      regulate stem cell activities, cell proliferation, cell fate transition, and auxin 
      production, thereby contributing to plant regeneration. In addition, jasmonate is 
      strictly controlled in plant cells via restriction of the jasmonate concentration 
      and its signalling pathway in a spatial and temporal manner during regeneration. 
      Overall, jasmonate acts as the hormone linking wounding to distinct types of 
      regeneration in plants.

TI  - Auxin guides germ-cell specification in Arabidopsis anthers.
LID - 10.1073/pnas.2101492118 [doi]
LID - e2101492118
AB  - Germ cells (GCs) are the key carriers delivering genetic information from one 
      generation to the next. In a majority of animals, GCs segregate from somatic cells 
      during embryogenesis by forming germlines. In land plants, GCs segregate from 
      somatic cells during postembryonic development. In a majority of angiosperms, male 
      GCs (archesporial cells) initiate at the four corners of the anther primordia. 
      Little is known about the mechanism underlying this initiation. Here, we discovered 
      that the dynamic auxin distribution in developing anthers coincided with GC 
      initiation. A centripetal auxin gradient gradually formed toward the four corners 
      where GCs will initiate. Local auxin biosynthesis was necessary for this patterning 
      and for GC specification. The GC determinant protein SPOROCYTELESS/NOZZLE (SPL/NZZ) 
      mediated the effect of auxin on GC specification and modified auxin biosynthesis to 
      maintain a centripetal auxin distribution. Our work reveals that auxin is a key 
      factor guiding GC specification in Arabidopsis anthers. Moreover, we demonstrate 
      that the GC segregation from somatic cells is not a simple switch on/off event but 
      rather a complicated process that involves a dynamic feedback circuit among local 
      auxin biosynthesis, transcription of SPL/NZZ, and a progressive GC specification. 
      This finding sheds light on the mystery of how zygote-derived somatic cells diverge 
      into GCs in plants.

TI  - Early nodulin 93 protein gene: essential for induction of somatic embryogenesis in 
      oil palm.
PG  - 1395-1413
LID - 10.1007/s00299-020-02571-7 [doi]
AB  - Transcript profiling during the early induction phase of oil palm tissue culture and 
      RNAi studies in a model somatic embryogenesis system showed that EgENOD93 expression 
      is essential for somatic embryogenesis. Micropropagation of oil palm through tissue 
      culture is vital for the generation of superior and uniform elite planting 
      materials. Studies were carried out to identify genes to distinguish between leaf 
      explants with the potential to develop into embryogenic or non-embryogenic callus. 
      Oil palm cDNA microarrays were co-hybridized with cDNA probes of reference tissue, 
      separately with embryo forming (media T527) and non-embryo (media T694) forming leaf 
      explants sampled at Day 7, Day 14 and Day 21. Analysis of the normalized datasets 
      has identified 77, 115 and 127 significantly differentially expressed genes at Day 
      7, Day 14, and Day 21, respectively. An early nodulin 93 protein gene (ENOD93), was 
      highly expressed at Day 7, Day 14, and Day 21 and in callus (media T527), as 
      assessed by RT-qPCR. Validation of EgENOD93 across tissue culture lines of different 
      genetic background and media composition showed the potential of this gene as an 
      embryogenic marker. In situ RNA hybridization and functional characterization in 
      Medicago truncatula provided additional evidence that ENOD93 is essential for 
      somatic embryogenesis. This study supports the suitability of EgENOD93 as a marker 
      to predict the potential of leaf explants to produce embryogenic callus. Crosstalk 
      among stresses, auxin, and Nod-factor like signalling molecules likely induces the 
      expression of EgENOD93 for embryogenic callus formation.

AB  - DEAD-box (DDX) proteins belong to the largest subfamily of RNA helicase SF2, which 
      contributes to all biological processes of RNA metabolism in the plant kingdom. Till 
      now, no significant data are available regarding studies on DDX in Somatic 
      Embryogenesis (SE) of woody plants. It is important to investigate the biological 
      function of the DlDDX family in longan SE. Thus, a comprehensive analysis of 58 
      longan DEAD-box (DlDDX) genes characterization was performed by genome-wide 
      identification and transcript abundance validation analysis. Homologous evolution 
      has revealed that some DlDDXs in longan had high sequence similarity with Mus 
      musculus, Citrus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, indicating that DlDDXs were highly 
      conservative in the animal, plant, and microorganism. Remarkably, gene duplication, 
      purifying selection, and alternative splicing events, and new auxiliary domains have 
      likely contributed to the functional evolution of DlDDX, indicating that DlDDX 
      appeared neofunctionalization in longan. Besides, DlDDX3, 15, 28, 36 might interact 
      with protein complex (MAC3A, MAC3B, CDC5, CBP20) of miRNA biosynthesis. Notably, 
      DlDDX28 contained a novel auxiliary domain (CAF-1 p150), which might contribute to 
      DNA demethylation in longan early SE. 4 DlDDX genes significantly expressed not only 
      in early SE and zygotic embryogenesis (ZE) but also up-regulated at high levels in 
      'Honghezi' and 'Quanlongbaihe' with abortive seeds, which are of great significance. 
      Moreover, some DlDDXs presented abiotic stress-response dynamic expression patterns 
      by ABA, SA, JA, and NaCl treatments during early SE. Hence, DEAD-box is essential to 
      SE development and seed abortive in longan.

TI  - Phenylpropanoids Are Connected to Cell Wall Fortification and Stress Tolerance in 
      Avocado Somatic Embryogenesis.
LID - 10.3390/ijms21165679 [doi]
LID - 5679
AB  - Somatic embryogenesis (SE) is a valuable model for understanding the mechanism of 
      plant embryogenesis and a tool for the mass production of plants. However, 
      establishing SE in avocado has been complicated due to the very low efficiency of 
      embryo induction and plant regeneration. To understand the molecular foundation of 
      the SE induction and development in avocado, we compared embryogenic (EC) and 
      non-embryogenic (NEC) cultures of two avocado varieties using proteomic and 
      metabolomic approaches. Although Criollo and Hass EC exhibited similarities in the 
      proteome and metabolome profile, in general, we observed a more active 
      phenylpropanoid pathway in EC than NEC. This pathway is associated with the 
      tolerance of stress responses, probably through the reinforcement of the cell wall 
      and flavonoid production. We could corroborate that particular polyphenolics 
      compounds, including p-coumaric acid and t-ferulic acid, stimulated the production 
      of somatic embryos in avocado. Exogen phenolic compounds were associated with the 
      modification of the content of endogenous polyphenolic and the induction of the 
      production of the putative auxin-a, adenosine, cellulose and 
      1,26-hexacosanediol-diferulate. We suggest that in EC of avocado, there is an 
      enhanced phenylpropanoid metabolism for the production of the building blocks of 
      lignin and flavonoid compounds having a role in cell wall reinforcement for 
      tolerating stress response. Data are available at ProteomeXchange with the 
      identifier PXD019705.

      embryogenesis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In citrus, genetic improvement via biotechnology is hindered by the 
      obstacle of in vitro regeneration via somatic embryogenesis (SE). Although a few B3 
      transcription factors are reported to regulate embryogenesis, little is known about 
      the B3 superfamily in citrus, and which members might be involved in SE. RESULTS: 
      Genome-wide sequence analysis identified 72 (CsB3) and 69 (CgB3) putative B3 
      superfamily members in the genomes of sweet orange (Citrus sinensis, polyembryonic) 
      and pummelo (C. grandis, monoembryonic), respectively. Genome duplication analysis 
      indicated that segmental and tandem duplication events contributed to the expansion 
      of the B3 superfamily in citrus, and that the B3 superfamily evolved under the 
      effect of purifying selection. Phylogenetic relationships were well supported by 
      conserved gene structure and motifs outside the B3 domain, which allowed possible 
      functions to be inferred by comparison with homologous genes from Arabidopsis. 
      Expression analysis identified 23 B3 superfamily members that were expressed during 
      SE in citrus and 17 that may play functional roles at late SE stages. Eight B3 genes 
      were identified that were specific to the genome of polyembryonic sweet orange 
      compared to monoembryonic pummelo. Of these eight B3 genes, CsARF19 was found to be 
      specifically expressed at higher levels in embryogenic callus (EC), implying its 
      possible involvement in EC initiation. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a 
      genome-wide analysis of the citrus B3 superfamily, including its genome 
      organization, evolutionary features and expression profiles, and identifies specific 
      family members that may be associated with SE.

AB  - Daucus carota L. (carrot) is one of the ten most important vegetables cultivated and 
      consumed worldwide and is a main source of provitamin A. Carrot storage root is rich 
      in dietary fiber, antioxidants, and other nutrients but especially in carotenoids. 
      It has been also used as plant model for studding embryogenesis, as well as the 
      genetic and genomic evolution of carrots and for carotenoid synthesis regulation, 
      among others. Research in carrot often needs genetic transformation. Here we 
      describe a step-by-step protocol on the nuclear and stable transformation of carrot 
      through Agrobacterium tumefaciens and somatic embryogenesis in vitro culture. 
      Somatic embryos, induced by supplementation of Murashige-Skoog medium with the 2,4D 
      hormone, develop into seedlings after 6 months approximately when plants are ready 
      to be transferred to a greenhouse. The protocol has over 85% of transformation 
      efficiency.

TI  - In silico characterization of putative gene homologues involved in somatic 
      embryogenesis suggests that some conifer species may lack LEC2, one of the key 
      regulators of initiation of the process.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Somatic embryogenesis (SE) is the process in which somatic embryos 
      develop from somatic tissue in vitro on medium in most cases supplemented with 
      growth regulators. Knowledge of genes involved in regulation of initiation and of 
      development of somatic embryos is crucial for application of SE as an efficient tool 
      to enable genetic improvement across genotypes by clonal propagation. RESULTS: 
      Current work presents in silico identification of putative homologues of central 
      regulators of SE initiation and development in conifers focusing mainly on key 
      transcription factors (TFs) e.g. BBM, LEC1, LEC1-LIKE, LEC2 and FUSCA3, based on 
      sequence similarity using BLASTP. Protein sequences of well-characterised candidates 
      genes from Arabidopsis thaliana were used to query the databases (Gymno PLAZA, 
      Congenie, GenBank) including whole-genome sequence data from two representative 
      species from the genus Picea (Picea abies) and Pinus (Pinus taeda), for finding 
      putative conifer homologues, using BLASTP. Identification of corresponding conifer 
      proteins was further confirmed by domain search (Conserved Domain Database), 
      alignment (MUSCLE) with respective sequences of Arabidopsis thaliana proteins and 
      phylogenetic analysis (Phylogeny.fr). CONCLUSIONS: This in silico analysis suggests 
      absence of LEC2 in Picea abies and Pinus taeda, the conifer species whose genomes 
      have been sequenced. Based on available sequence data to date, LEC2 was also not 
      detected in the other conifer species included in the study. LEC2 is one of the key 
      TFs associated with initiation and regulation of the process of SE in angiosperms. 
      Potential alternative mechanisms that might be functional in conifers to compensate 
      the lack of LEC2 are discussed.

AB  - Cultivated cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) is heavily attacked by various species of 
      insects worldwide and breeding of new varieties resistant to pests is still a hard 
      battle to win. RNAi technology is an important reverse genetics tool to induce gene 
      silencing in eukaryotic organisms and produce phenotypic modifications. In cotton, 
      RNAi was applied to investigate gene function and enhance resistance to insects and 
      pathogens. Different methods and techniques can be used to synthetize double 
      stranded RNA (dsRNA) into plant cells. The Agrobacterium-mediated transformation is 
      a common method to introduce RNAi binary plasmids into cotton genome and obtain 
      stable transgenics plants. This methodology includes the coculture of cotton tissues 
      with Agrobacterium cultures, selection of transgenic cells and induction of somatic 
      embryogenesis to finally obtain transgenic plants after a relatively long period of 
      time. The transient synthesis of dsRNA mediated by virus-induced gene silencing 
      (VIGS) in cotton is an alternative to anticipate the silencing effect of a specific 
      RNA sequence, prior to the development of a stable transgenic plant. VIGS vectors 
      are incorporated into the plant by agroinfiltration technique. During VIGS 
      replication inside plant cells, synthetized dsRNA allows the study on specific 
      heterologous gene expression including the phenotypic effect on herbivorous target 
      pests, thus facilitating a rapid evaluation of dsRNA expressed in cotton plants 
      against individual insect target genes. Here we describe the complementation of 
      these two techniques to evaluate RNAi-based cotton plant protection against insect 
      pests.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) models and optimization algorithms (OA) are broadly 
      employed in different fields of technology and science and have recently been 
      applied to improve different stages of plant tissue culture. The usefulness of the 
      application of AI-OA has been demonstrated in the prediction and optimization of 
      length and number of microshoots or roots, biomass in plant cell cultures or hairy 
      root culture, and optimization of environmental conditions to achieve maximum 
      productivity and efficiency, as well as classification of microshoots and somatic 
      embryos. Despite its potential, the use of AI and OA in this field has been limited 
      due to complex definition terms and computational algorithms. Therefore, a 
      systematic review to unravel modeling and optimizing methods is important for plant 
      researchers and has been acknowledged in this study. First, the main steps for AI-OA 
      development (from data selection to evaluation of prediction and classification 
      models), as well as several AI models such as artificial neural networks (ANNs), 
      neurofuzzy logic, support vector machines (SVMs), decision trees, random forest 
      (FR), and genetic algorithms (GA), have been represented. Then, the application of 
      AI-OA models in different steps of plant tissue culture has been discussed and 
      highlighted. This review also points out limitations in the application of AI-OA in 
      different plant tissue culture processes and provides a new view for future study 
      objectives. KEY POINTS: • Artificial intelligence models and optimization algorithms 
      can be considered a novel and reliable computational method in plant tissue culture. 
      • This review provides the main steps and concepts for model development. • The 
      application of machine learning algorithms in different steps of plant tissue 
      culture has been discussed and highlighted.

AB  - Vegetative propagation through somatic embryogenesis is an effective method to 
      produce elite varieties and can be applied as a tool to study the response of plants 
      to different stresses. Several studies show that environmental changes during 
      embryogenesis could determine future plant development. Moreover, we previously 
      reported that physical and chemical conditions during somatic embryogenesis can 
      determine the protein, hormone and metabolite profiles, as well as the 
      micromorphological and ultrastructural organization of embryonal masses and somatic 
      embryos. In this sense, phytohormones are key players throughout the somatic 
      embryogenesis process as well as during numerous stress-adaptation responses. In 
      this work, we first applied different high-temperature regimes (30 °C, 4 weeks; 40 
      °C, 4 days; 50 °C, 5 min) during induction of Pinus radiata D. Don somatic 
      embryogenesis, together with control temperature (23 °C). Then, the somatic plants 
      regenerated from initiated embryogenic cell lines and cultivated in greenhouse 
      conditions were subjected to drought stress and control treatments to evaluate 
      survival, growth and several physiological traits (relative water content, water 
      potential, photosynthesis, stomatal conductance and transpiration). Based on those 
      preliminary results, even more extreme high-temperature regimes were applied during 
      induction (40 °C, 4 h; 50 °C, 30 min; 60 °C, 5 min) and the corresponding cytokinin 
      profiles of initiated embryonal masses from different lines were analysed. The 
      results showed that the temperature regime during induction had delayed negative 
      effects on drought resilience of somatic plants as indicated by survival, 
      photosynthetic activity and water- use efficiency. However, high temperatures for 
      extended periods of time enhanced subsequent plant growth in well-watered 
      conditions. High-temperature regime treatments induced significant differences in 
      the profile of total cytokinin bases, N6-isopentenyladenine, cis-zeatin riboside and 
      trans-zeatin riboside. We concluded that phytohormones could be potential regulators 
      of stress-response processes during initial steps of somatic embryogenesis and that 
      they may have delayed implications in further developmental processes, determining 
      the performance of the generated plants.

TI  - Tissue Culture Response of Ornamental and Medicinal Aesculus Species-A Review.
LID - 277 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/plants11030277 [doi]
AB  - Species of the genus Aesculus are very attractive woody ornamentals. Their organs 
      contain numerous health-promoting phytochemicals. The most valuable of 
      them-aescin-is used in commercial preparations for the treatment of venous 
      insufficiency. The industrial source of aescin is horse chestnut seeds because the 
      zygotic embryos are the main site of its accumulation. Horse chestnut somatic and 
      zygotic embryos contain similar amount of aescin, hence somatic embryos could be 
      exploited as an alternative source of aescin. Somatic embryogenesis, androgenesis 
      and de novo shoot organogenesis were successfully achieved in several Aesculus 
      species, as well as secondary somatic embryogenesis and shoot organogenesis, which 
      enables mass production of embryos and shoots. In addition, an efficient method for 
      cryopreservation of embryogenic tissue was established, assuring constant 
      availability of the plant material. The developed methods are suitable for clonal 
      propagation of elite specimens selected as the best aescin producers, the most 
      attractive ornamentals or plants resistant to pests and diseases. These methods are 
      also useful for molecular breeding purposes. Thus, in this review, the medicinal 
      uses and a comprehensive survey of in vitro propagation methods established for 
      Aesculus species, as well as the feasibility of in vitro production of aescin, are 
      presented and discussed.

TI  - Global scale transcriptome analysis reveals differentially expressed genes involve 
      in early somatic embryogenesis in Dimocarpus longan Lour.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Somatic embryogenesis (SE) is a process of somatic cells that 
      dedifferentiate to totipotent embryonic stem cells and generate embryos in vitro. 
      Longan SE has been established and wildly used as model system for studying 
      embryogenesis in woody plants, SE-related genes had been characterized. In spite of 
      that, a comprehensive overview of SE at a molecular level is still absent. To 
      understand the molecular mechanisms during longan SE, we examined the transcriptome 
      changes by using Illumina HiSeq from the four distinct developmental stages, 
      including non-embryogenic callus (NEC), embryogenic callus (EC), incomplete compact 
      pro-embryogenic cultures (ICpEC), globular embryos (GE). RESULTS: RNA-seq of the 
      four samples generated a total of 243.78 million high quality reads, approximately 
      81.5% of the data were mapped to longan genome. The cDNA libraries of NEC, EC, ICpEC 
      and GE, generated 22,743, 19,745, 21,144, 21,102 expressed transcripts, 1935, 1710, 
      1816, 1732 novel transcripts, 2645, 366, 505, 588 unique genes, respectively. 
      Comparative transcriptome analysis showed that a total of 10,642, 4180, 5846 and 
      1785 genes were differentially expressed in the pairwise comparisons of NEC_vs_EC, 
      EC_vs_ICpEC, EC_vs_GE, ICpEC_vs_GE, respectively. Among them, plant hormones 
      signalling related genes were significantly enriched, especially the auxin and 
      cytokinin signalling components. The transcripts of flavonoid biosynthesis related 
      genes were mainly expressed in NEC, while fatty acid biosynthesis related genes 
      mainly accumulated in early SE. In addition, the extracelluar protein encoding genes 
      LTP, CHI, GLP, AGP, EP1 were related to longan SE. Combined with the FPKM value of 
      longan nine tissues transcription, 27 SE specific or preferential genes (LEC1, 
      LEC1-like, PDF1.3, GH3.6, AGL80, PIN1, BBM, WOX9, WOX2, ABI3, et al.) and 28 NEC 
      preferential genes (LEA5, CNOT3, DC2.15, PR1-1, NsLTP2, DIR1, PIP1, PIP2.1, TIP2-1, 
      POD-P7 and POD5 et al.) were characterized as molecular markers for longan early SE. 
      qRT-PCR validation of SE-related genes showed a high correlation between RNA-seq and 
      qRT-PCR data. CONCLUSION: This study provides new insights into the role of the 
      transcriptome during early SE in longan. Differentially expressed genes reveal that 
      plant hormones signalling, flavonoid and fatty acid biosynthesis, and extracelluar 
      protein related genes were involved in longan early SE. It could serve as a valuable 
      platform resource for further functional studies addressing embryogenesis in woody 
      plants.

TI  - Tissue culture-induced DNA methylation in crop plants: a review.
PG  - 823-841
LID - 10.1007/s11033-020-06062-6 [doi]
AB  - Plant tissue culture techniques have been extensively employed in commercial 
      micropropagation to provide year-round production. Tissue culture regenerants are 
      not always genotypically and phenotypically similar. Due to the changes in the 
      tissue culture microenvironment, plant cells are exposed to additional stress which 
      induces genetic and epigenetic instabilities in the regenerants. These changes lead 
      to tissue culture-induced variations (TCIV) which are also known as somaclonal 
      variations to categorically specify the inducing environment. TCIV includes 
      molecular and phenotypic changes persuaded in the in vitro culture due to continuous 
      sub-culturing and tissue culture-derived stress. Epigenetic variations such as 
      altered DNA methylation pattern are induced due to the above-mentioned factors. 
      Reportedly, alteration in DNA methylation pattern is much more frequent in the plant 
      genome during the tissue culture process. DNA methylation plays an important role in 
      gene expression and regulation of plant development. Variants originated in tissue 
      culture process due to heritable methylation changes, can contribute to 
      intra-species phenotypic variation. Several molecular techniques are available to 
      detect DNA methylation at different stages of in vitro culture. Here, we review the 
      aspects of TCIV with respect to DNA methylation and its effect on crop improvement 
      programs. It is anticipated that a precise and comprehensive knowledge of molecular 
      basis of in vitro-derived DNA methylation will help to design strategies to overcome 
      the bottlenecks of micropropagation system and maintain the clonal fidelity of the 
      regenerants.

TI  - An Overview of Orchid Protocorm-Like Bodies: Mass Propagation, Biotechnology, 
      Molecular Aspects, and Breeding.
LID - 10.3390/ijms21030985 [doi]
LID - 985
AB  - The process through induction, proliferation and regeneration of protocorm-like 
      bodies (PLBs) is one of the most advantageous methods for mass propagation of 
      orchids which applied to the world floricultural market. In addition, this method 
      has been used as a tool to identify genes of interest associated with the production 
      of PLBs, and also in breeding techniques that use biotechnology to produce new 
      cultivars, such as to obtain transgenic plants. Most of the molecular studies 
      developed have used model plants as species of Phalaenopsis, and interestingly, 
      despite similarities to somatic embryogenesis, some molecular differences do not yet 
      allow to characterize that PLB induction is in fact a type of somatic embryogenesis. 
      Despite the importance of species for conservation and collection purposes, the 
      flower market is supported by hybrid cultivars, usually polyploid, which makes more 
      detailed molecular evaluations difficult. Studies on the effect of plant growth 
      regulators on induction, proliferation, and regeneration of PLBs are the most 
      numerous. However, studies of other factors and new technologies affecting PLB 
      production such as the use of temporary immersion bioreactors and the use of 
      lighting-emitting diodes have emerged as new tools for advancing the technique with 
      increasing PLB production efficiency. In addition, recent studies on Phalaenopsis 
      equestris genome sequencing have enabled more detailed molecular studies and the 
      molecular characterization of plantlets obtained from this technique currently allow 
      the technique to be evaluated in a more comprehensive way regarding its real 
      applications and main limitations aiming at mass propagation, such as somaclonal 
      variation.

AB  - Auxin plays a central role in growth and plant development. To maintain auxin 
      homeostasis, biological processes such as biosynthesis, transport, degradation, and 
      reversible conjugation are essential. The Gretchen Hagen 3 (GH3) family genes codify 
      for the enzymes that esterify indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) to various amino acids, 
      which is a key process in the induction of somatic embryogenesis (SE). The GH3 
      family is one of the principal families of early response to auxin genes, exhibiting 
      IAA-amido synthetase activity to maintain optimal levels of free auxin in the cell. 
      In this study, we carried out a systematic identification of the GH3 gene family in 
      the genome of Coffea canephora, determining a total of 18 CcGH3 genes. Analysis of 
      the genetic structures and phylogenetic relationships of CcGH3 genes with GH3 genes 
      from other plant species revealed that they could be clustered in two major 
      categories with groups 1 and 2 of the GH3 family of Arabidopsis. We analyzed the 
      transcriptome expression profiles of the 18 CcGH3 genes using RNA-Seq analysis-based 
      data and qRT-PCR during the different points of somatic embryogenesis induction. 
      Furthermore, the endogenous quantification of free and conjugated indole-3-acetic 
      acid (IAA) suggests that the various members of the CcGH3 genes play a crucial role 
      during the embryogenic process of C. canephora. Three-dimensional modeling of the 
      selected CcGH3 proteins showed that they consist of two domains: an extensive 
      N-terminal domain and a smaller C-terminal domain. All proteins analyzed in the 
      present study shared a unique conserved structural topology. Additionally, we 
      identified conserved regions that could function to bind nucleotides and specific 
      amino acids for the conjugation of IAA during SE in C. canephora. These results 
      provide a better understanding of the C. canephora GH3 gene family for further 
      exploration and possible genetic manipulation.

TI  - Development of a system for efficient callus production, somatic embryogenesis and 
      gene editing using CRISPR/Cas9 in Saffron (Crocus sativus L.).
PG  - 47

LID - 47
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crocus sativus is a recalcitrant plant for genetic transformation and 
      genetic improvement, largely due to difficulties in Agrobacterium mediated 
      transformation and vegetative reproduction. Effective genome editing requires 
      proficient callus production and an efficient method to deliver Cas9 and sgRNAs into 
      the plant. Here, we demonstrate Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of saffron. 
      Further, we developed a CRISPR-Cas9 based system in this plant, for efficient gene 
      knockout or edits in future. RESULTS: Efficient callus production and regeneration 
      confers important benefits in developing competent transformation system in plants. 
      More than 70% multiplication rate of callus initiation was achieved from corm slices 
      of saffron subjected to a two-step sterilization procedure and grown on complete MS 
      medium supplemented with 2,4-D (0.5 mg/L), BAP (1 mg/L), IAA (1 mg/L), photoperiod 
      of 16/8 h and 45% relative humidity at 20 ± 2 °C. In vitro cormlet generation was 
      accomplished in 8 weeks by using mature somatic embryos on MS medium supplemented 
      with TDZ (0.5 mg/L) + IAA (1 mg/L) + Activated charcoal (0.1 g/L) at 15 ± 2 °C. The 
      attempt of using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation resulted in successful 
      integration of the binary vector into the somatic embryos of saffron with a 
      transformation efficiency of 4%. PCR and Southern blot analysis confirmed the 
      integration of Cas9 into saffron. CONCLUSION: The protocol for callus production, 
      somatic embryogenesis and regeneration was standardised. Successful demonstration of 
      integrated Cas9 in this study constitutes first step in developing strategies for 
      genetic manipulation of saffron, which has so far been considered recalcitrant. 
      Furthering the development of this technology holds significant potential for 
      advancing genetic research in saffron by integrating multigene targeting and/or use 
      of recyclable cassettes.

LID - 10.1007/978-1-0716-1335-1_19 [doi]
AB  - Anther culture provides a tool to produce haploid lines from cultivated potato 
      (Solanum tuberosum L.), which has a tetraploid (2n = 4x = 48) genome constitution. 
      Shoot regeneration via direct embryogenesis in anther culture procedure is preferred 
      to produce dihaploid (2n = 2x = 24) potato lines, which can be applied in breeding 
      of potato varieties. The anther culture protocol described in the present chapter 
      can be conducted not only in cultivated potato (S. tuberosum) but also in other 
      genetically related potato species.

TI  - The EAR Motif in the Arabidopsis MADS Transcription Factor AGAMOUS-Like 15 Is Not 
      Necessary to Promote Somatic Embryogenesis.
LID - 10.3390/plants10040758 [doi]
LID - 758
AB  - AGAMOUS-like 15 (AGL15) is a member of the MADS domain family of transcription 
      factors (TFs) that can directly induce and repress target gene expression, and for 
      which promotion of somatic embryogenesis (SE) is positively correlated with 
      accumulation. An ethylene-responsive element binding factor-associated amphiphilic 
      repression (EAR) motif of form LxLxL within the carboxyl-terminal domain of AGL15 
      was shown to be involved in repression of gene expression. Here, we examine whether 
      AGL15's ability to repress gene expression is needed to promote SE. While a form of 
      AGL15 where the LxLxL is changed to AxAxA can still promote SE, another form with a 
      strong transcriptional activator at the carboxy-terminal end, does not promote SE 
      and, in fact, is detrimental to SE development. Select target genes were examined 
      for response to the different forms of AGL15.

TI  - The Origin of the Cyathea delgadii Sternb. Somatic Embryos Is Determined by the 
      Developmental State of Donor Tissue and Mutual Balance of Selected Metabolites.
LID - 10.3390/cells10061388 [doi]
LID - 1388
AB  - Somatic embryogenesis is the formation of a plant embryo from a cell other than the 
      product of gametic fusion. The need to recognize the determinants of somatic cell 
      fate has prompted investigations on how endogenous factors of donor tissues can 
      determine the pattern of somatic embryo origin. The undertaking of this study was 
      enabled by the newly developed experimental system of somatic embryogenesis of the 
      tree fern Cyathea delgadii Sternb., in which the embryos are produced in 
      hormone-free medium. The contents of 89 endogenous compounds (such as sugars, 
      auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, stress-related hormones, phenolic acids, 
      polyamines, and amino acids) and cytomorphological features were compared between 
      two types of explants giving rise to somatic embryos of unicellular or multicellular 
      origin. We found that a large content of maltose, 1-kestose, abscisic acid, 
      biologically active gibberellins, and phenolic acids was characteristic for 
      single-cell somatic embryo formation pattern. In contrast, high levels of starch, 
      callose, kinetin riboside, arginine, and ethylene promoted their multicellular 
      origin. Networks for visualization of the relations between studied compounds were 
      constructed based on the data obtained from analyses of a Pearson correlation 
      coefficient heatmap. Our findings present for the first time detailed features of 
      donor tissue that can play an important role in the somatic-to-embryogenic 
      transition and the somatic embryo origin.

TI  - Improvement of a Genetic Transformation System and Preliminary Study on the Function 
      of LpABCB21 and LpPILS7 Based on Somatic Embryogenesis in Lilium pumilum DC. Fisch.
LID - 10.3390/ijms21186784 [doi]
LID - 6784
AB  - Auxin transport mediates the asymmetric distribution of auxin that determines the 
      fate of cell development. Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation is an 
      important technical means to study gene function. Our previous study showed that the 
      expression levels of LpABCB21 and LpPILS7 are significantly up-regulated in the 
      somatic embryogenesis (SE) of Lilium pumilum DC. Fisch. (L. pumilum), but the 
      functions of both genes remain unclear. Here, the genetic transformation technology 
      previously developed by our team based on the L.pumilum system was improved, and the 
      genetic transformation efficiency increased by 5.7-13.0%. Use of overexpression and 
      CRISPR/Cas9 technology produced three overexpression and seven mutant lines of 
      LpABCB21, and seven overexpression and six mutant lines of LpPILS7. Analysis of the 
      differences in somatic embryo induction of transgenic lines confirmed that LpABCB21 
      regulates the early formation of the somatic embryo; however, excessive expression 
      level of LpABCB21 inhibits somatic embryo induction efficiency. LpPILS7 mainly 
      regulates somatic embryo induction efficiency. This study provides a more efficient 
      method of genetic transformation of L. pumilum. LpABCB21 and LpPILS7 are confirmed 
      to have important regulatory roles in L. pumilum SE thus laying the foundation for 
      subsequent studies of the molecular mechanism of Lilium SE.

AB  - Hemidesmus indicus (L.) R. Br. ex Schult is commonly known as anantmul or Indian 
      sarsaparilla. The roots of this plant, which display a wide range of medicinal, 
      biological, and phytopharmaceutical properties, are used in the pharmaceutical and 
      food industries. Conventionally, the plant is propagated by seed germination or 
      vegetatively, but the efficacy of traditional methods has some limitations: plants 
      derived from seed germination are prone to seed-borne diseases, or plantlet 
      production using vegetative propagation is limited. In contrast, plant tissue 
      culture allows for large-scale propagation and secondary metabolite production in 
      vitro without sacrificing plants from their natural habitats. Many efforts have been 
      made over 40 years of research to establish efficient micropropagation protocols to 
      speed up cultivation of this plant, including callus-mediated in vitro propagation, 
      somatic embryogenesis, and shoot multiplication using cotyledenory nodes, stem 
      segments, shoot tips, and nodal explants. Among these explants, nodal explants are 
      the most commonly used for H. indicus micropropagation. The application of adenine 
      sulfate, citric acid, ascorbic acid, and arginine may be useful in preventing 
      explant browning, premature leaf senescence, and shoot tip abscission during in 
      vitro culture. This review provides insight into micropropagation, use of synthetic 
      seeds for short-term germplasm preservation, and in vitro production of secondary 
      metabolites such as 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzaldehyde, lupeol, vanillin, and rutin, 
      from in vitro root and callus cultures. Furthermore, unexplored and possible 
      innovative areas of research in Hemidesmus biotechnology are also discussed. KEY 
      POINTS: • Hemidesmus indicus has multiple therapeutic applications. • H. indicus 
      roots are used in confectionary and pharmacy. • This review comprehensively assesses 
      H. indicus tissue culture. • Challenges and future research of H. indicus 
      biotechnology are discussed.

AB  - miRNAs are endogenous regulatory factors that play pivotal roles in 
      post-transcriptional regulation. However, their specific roles in early somatic 
      embryogenesis (SE) remain unclear. Study of the SE system is fundamental for 
      clarifying the molecular mechanisms in Dimocarpus longan. We identified 289 known 
      miRNAs from 106 different miRNA families and 1087 novel miRNAs during early longan 
      SE, including embryogenic callus (EC), incomplete pro-embryogenic culture (ICpEC), 
      globular embryo (GE), and non-embryogenic callus (NEC). The abundances of known 
      miRNAs were concentrated in GE. The differentially expression (DE) miRNAs showed 
      five expression patterns during early SE. Largely miRNAs were expressed highly and 
      specially in EC, ICpEC, and GE, respectively. Some miRNAs and putative target genes 
      were enriched in lignin metabolism. Most potential targets were related to the 
      pathways of plant hormone signal transduction, alternative splicing, tyrosine 
      metabolism and sulfur metabolism in early longan SE. The regulatory relationships 
      between dlo-miR166a-3p and DlHD-zip8, dlo-miR397a and DlLAC7, dlo-miR408-3p and 
      DlLAC12 were confirmed by RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The 
      expression patterns of eight DE miRNAs detected by qRT-PCR were consistent with 
      RNA-seq. Finally, the miRNA regulatory network in early SE was constructed, which 
      provided new insight into molecular mechanism of early SE in longan.

TI  - The Arabinogalactan Protein Family of Centaurium erythraea Rafn.
LID - 10.3390/plants10091870 [doi]
LID - 1870
AB  - Centaurium erythraea (centaury) is a medicinal plant with exceptional developmental 
      plasticity in vitro and vigorous, often spontaneous, regeneration via shoot 
      organogenesis and somatic embryogenesis, during which arabinogalactan proteins 
      (AGPs) play an important role. AGPs are highly glycosylated proteins belonging to 
      the super family of O-glycosylated plant cell surface hydroxyproline-rich 
      glycoproteins (HRGPs). HRGPs/AGPs are intrinsically disordered and not well 
      conserved, making their homology-based mining ineffective. We have applied a 
      recently developed pipeline for HRGP/AGP mining, ragp, which is based on machine 
      learning prediction of proline hydroxylation, to identify HRGP sequences in centaury 
      transcriptome and to classify them into motif and amino acid bias (MAAB) classes. 
      AGP sequences with low AG glycomotif representation were also identified. Six 
      members of each of the three AGP subclasses, fasciclin-like AGPs, receptor 
      kinase-like AGPs and AG peptides, were selected for phylogenetic and expression 
      analyses. The expression of these 18 genes was recorded over 48 h following leaf 
      mechanical wounding, as well as in 16 tissue samples representing plants from 
      nature, plants cultivated in vitro, and developmental stages during shoot 
      organogenesis and somatic embryogenesis. None of the selected genes were upregulated 
      during both wounding recovery and regeneration. Possible functions of AGPs with the 
      most interesting expression profiles are discussed.

AB  - Somatic embryogenesis (SE) faces many challenges in fulfilling the growing demand 
      for elite materials. A high-throughput approach is required to accelerate the 
      optimization of SE protocols by multiplying experimental conditions within a limited 
      time period. For the first time in plant micropropagation, we have developed a 
      miniaturized and automated screening system to meet high-throughput standards. 
      Coffea arabica embryo regeneration, classically achieved in 250-ml Erlenmeyer 
      flasks, was successfully miniaturized in 24-well plates, allowing a volume 
      downscaling factor of 100 and a space saving of 53 cm(2)/well. Cell clusters were 
      ground and filtered to fit the automated pipetting platform, leading to fast, 
      reproducible and uniform cluster distribution (23.0 ± 5.5 cell clusters/well) and 
      successful regeneration (6.5 ± 2.2 embryos/well). Pilot screening of active 
      compounds on SE was carried out. Compounds belonging to the histone deacetylase 
      inhibitor family were tested for embryo regeneration efficiency. Cells treated with 
      1 µM Trichostatin A showed a marked 3-fold increase in the number of regenerated 
      embryos. When re-tested in 250-ml flasks, the same enhancement was obtained, thereby 
      validating the miniaturized and automated screening method. These results showed 
      that our screening system is reliable and well suited to screening hundreds of 
      compounds, offering unprecedented perspectives in plant micropropagation.

AB  - Somatic embryos are comparable to their zygotic counterparts for morphological 
      traits but are derived from somatic cells through various metabolic regulations, 
      collectively referred as somatic embryogenesis (SE). It has been well exploited for 
      germplasm conservation, genetic engineering, mutation breeding, for artificial seed 
      technology and as a tool for mass multiplication. Though somatic embryo development 
      is an important area of interest in growth, and developmental studies, the 
      underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. Therefore, understanding the 
      molecular basis behind somatic embryo development can provide insight into the 
      signaling pathways integrating this process. Proteomic analysis of somatic embryo 
      development in cv. Grand Naine (AAA) was carried out to identify the differentially 
      expressed protein during somatic embryo development stages, using two dimensional 
      gel electrophoresis together with mass spectrometry. In total, 25 protein spots were 
      differentially expressed during sequential developmental stages of somatic embryos. 
      Among these, three proteins were uniquely present in 30 days globular stage and six 
      proteins in 60 days old mature somatic embryo. Functional annotation of identified 
      spots showed that major proteins are involved in growth and developmental process 
      (17%) followed by defense response (12%) and signal transportation events (12%). In 
      the early stage, cell division and growth related proteins are involved in the 
      induction of somatic embryos whereas in the late developmental stage, cell wall 
      associated proteins along with stress related proteins played a defensive role 
      against dehydration and osmotic stress and resulted in the maturation of somatic 
      embryo. The identified stage specific proteins are valuable indicators and genetic 
      markers for screening and for media manipulation to improve SE efficiency in 
      recalcitrant crops and varieties.

LID - 10.1007/s00299-020-02568-2 [doi]
AB  - DNA methylation, morphogenesis and gene expression during the somatic embryogenesis 
      of Coconut are affected by 5-Azacytidine pretreatments, indicating that DNA 
      methylation is an important factor throughout this process. Somatic embryogenesis 
      (SE) is a process that can aid in the production of elite Cocos nucifera palms. It 
      has been well established that epigenetic mechanisms are regulators of cell 
      differentiation programs; however, their role in the coconut somatic embryogenesis 
      has not yet been addressed. To this end, the morphogenetic changes, the global DNA 
      methylation and the expression profiles of the SE-related genes and DNA 
      methyltransferases genes were evaluated during the SE process, with and without the 
      presence of 5-Azacytidine (AzaC). The results show that three days of pretreatments 
      with 15 µM and 20 µM of AzaC significantly increased early somatic embryo formation 
      (four- and tenfold, respectively). A clear peak of the global percentage of DNA 
      methylation (approximately 13%) was determined at the beginning of the culture, 
      followed by a re-establishing stage and a steady increase thereafter; in all cases, 
      the levels of DNA methylation were lower after the pretreatments with AzaC. 
      Additionally, the expression profiles of the SERK, WUS, BBM and LEC genes are 
      modulated during the SE process and the pretreatments with AzaC affect the 
      expression profiles of these genes, even at early stages. Furthermore, increased 
      levels of expression were observed for the genes encoding for DNA methyltransferases 
      (MET, CMT and DRM) at early and late stages of SE, indicating that DNA methylation 
      is an important factor throughout the SE.

TI  - Improving the Efficiency of Adventitious Shoot Induction and Somatic Embryogenesis 
      via Modification of WUSCHEL and LEAFY COTYLEDON 1.
LID - 10.3390/plants9111434 [doi]
LID - 1434
AB  - The induction of adventitious organs, such as calli, shoots, and somatic embryos, in 
      tissue culture is a useful technique for plant propagation and genetic modification. 
      In recent years, several genes have been reported to be adventitious organ inducers 
      and proposed to be useful for industrial applications. Even though the Arabidopsis 
      (Arabidopsis thaliana) WUSCHEL (WUS) and LEAFY COTYLEDON 1 (LEC1) genes can induce 
      adventitious organ formation in Arabidopsis without phytohormone treatment, further 
      improvement is desired. Here, we show that modifying the transcriptional 
      repression/activation activities of WUS and LEC1 improves the efficiency of 
      adventitious organ formation in Arabidopsis. Because WUS functions as a 
      transcriptional repressor during the induction of adventitious organs, we fused it 
      to an artificial strong repression domain, SUPERMAN REPRESSION DOMAIN X (SRDX). 
      Conversely, we fused the strong transcriptional activation domain VP16 from herpes 
      simplex virus to LEC1. Upon overexpression of the corresponding transgenes, we 
      succeeded in improving the efficiency of adventitious organ induction. Our results 
      show that the modification of transcriptional repression/activation activity offers 
      an effective method to improve the efficiency of adventitious organ formation in 
      plants.

TI  - Regulation of Three Key Kinases of Brassinosteroid Signaling Pathway.
LID - 10.3390/ijms21124340 [doi]
LID - 4340
AB  - Brassinosteroids (BRs) are important plant growth hormones that regulate a wide 
      range of plant growth and developmental processes. The BR signals are perceived by 
      two cell surface-localized receptor kinases, Brassinosteroid-Insensitive1 (BRI1) and 
      BRI1-Associated receptor Kinase (BAK1), and reach the nucleus through two master 
      transcription factors, bri1-EMS suppressor1 (BES1) and Brassinazole-resistant1 
      (BZR1). The intracellular transmission of the BR signals from BRI1/BAK1 to BES1/BZR1 
      is inhibited by a constitutively active kinase Brassinosteroid-Insensitive2 (BIN2) 
      that phosphorylates and negatively regulates BES1/BZR1. Since their initial 
      discoveries, further studies have revealed a plethora of biochemical and cellular 
      mechanisms that regulate their protein abundance, subcellular localizations, and 
      signaling activities. In this review, we provide a critical analysis of the current 
      literature concerning activation, inactivation, and other regulatory mechanisms of 
      three key kinases of the BR signaling cascade, BRI1, BAK1, and BIN2, and discuss 
      some unresolved controversies and outstanding questions that require further 
      investigation.

AB  - Somatic embryogenesis in Norway spruce combined with reverse genetics can be used as 
      a model to study the regulation of embryo development in conifers. The somatic 
      embryo system includes a sequence of developmental stages, which are similar in 
      morphology to their zygotic counterparts. The system can be sufficiently 
      synchronized to enable the collection and study of a large number of somatic embryos 
      at each developmental stage.Here we describe a protocol for establishing transgenic 
      cell lines in which genes of interest are upregulated or downregulated. Furthermore, 
      we present methods for comparing embryo morphology and development in transgenic and 
      control cell lines, including phenotyping the embryos, histological analysis, and 
      tracking embryo development. The expression pattern of different genes is determined 
      by GUS reporter assays.

AB  - Microspores, with a haploid number of chromosomes, are destined to produce the male 
      gametophyte, which hosts the male gametes that fertilize the female egg cell. During 
      microsporogenesis, a particular stage of development is amenable to be switched to 
      undergo embryogenesis and developed into a haploid plant. By doubling the 
      chromosomes, a doubled haploid plant, homozygous for all the gene loci, is produced. 
      These plants are useful to study the expression of recessive genes and in plant 
      breeding as a rapid pathway to achieve homozygosity.

AB  - Plant cell totipotency is one of the 25 major topics in current scientific research, 
      and somatic embryos are good experimental material for studying cell totipotency. 
      Polar auxin transport plays an important regulatory role in somatic embryogenesis 
      (SE). However, little is known about the auxin transport genes and their regulatory 
      mechanisms in Lilium SE. In this study, we applied single-molecule real-time (SMRT) 
      sequencing to Lilium pumilum DC. Fisch. for the first time and obtained a total of 
      119,649 transcripts, of which 14 encoded auxin transport genes. Correlation analyses 
      between somatic embryo induction and gene expression under different treatments 
      revealed that auxin transport genes, especially ATP-binding cassette (ABC) 
      transporter B family member 21 (ABCB21) and PIN-FORMED (PIN) LIKES 7 (PILS7), may be 
      key players in SE, and the necessary duration of picloram (PIC) treatment to induce 
      SE is as short as 3 days. Our research provides valuable genetic information on 
      Lilium pumilum, elucidating the candidate auxin transport genes involved in SE and 
      their influencing factors. This study lays a foundation for elucidating the 
      regulatory mechanism of auxin transport in SE.

AB  - Bountiful expression of bioactivity of phytochemicals obtained from spice crops like 
      coriander gifts them the label of being natural antioxidants. It is well-accepted 
      and time-tested towards contributing to human wellbeing. The accomplishment of 
      coriander production is fundamentally influenced by genetic, agroclimatic, and 
      agronomic factors. Despite the fact that there are very restricted options to manage 
      the first two factors, the third one is apparently imperative to arbitrate as far as 
      the elevated yield and enhanced quality are concerned. On the other hand, an 
      indomitable, object-oriented, controlled agrotechnological and biotechnological 
      intervention can also contribute towards better yield and quality of coriander. 
      There are several accounts of the successful use of such technologies in order to 
      genetically improve the qualitative and quantitative indicators of coriander. 
      However, often these areas are not comprehensively explored and utilized. In that 
      context, the present review highlights the botanical features, origin and 
      distribution, multi-dimensional importance, pre- and post-harvest crop management, 
      phytochemical production, and germplasm conservation, including the in vitro-based 
      regeneration methods along with molecular marker-based biotechnological and omics 
      approaches attempted in coriander until date. In addition, the possibility of the 
      yet-to-be-explored agri-biotechnological methods and their potential for genetic 
      improvement of this crop has also been reviewed in this appraisal. KEY POINTS: • 
      Coriander, used both as an herb and spice, is popular in the pharmaceutical and 
      culinary industries. • The current review provides insight into agrotechnological 
      and biotechnological interventions for better yield and quality. • Provides novel 
      ideas to harness the comprehensive qualitative and quantitative genetic improvement 
      based on the potential use of promising biotechnological tools and techniques.

AB  - The NAM, ATAF1/2, and CUC2 form a huge plant-specific gene family of NAC TFs that 
      are involved in the growth, development, and regulation of biotic and abiotic stress 
      responses. Although the draft genome of longan (Dimocarpus longan Lour.) has been 
      published, however the comprehensive data regarding the functions, evolution, and 
      expression patterns of the NAC family are still unavailable. In this study, a 
      comprehensive analysis of the NAC transcription factor family in longan was 
      performed, and a total of 114 NAC genes were found. We investigated the NAC gene 
      family exploring the phylogeny, domain conservation, intron/exon, motifs, 
      cis-regulatory elements, protein-protein interaction, and expression profiles of 
      RNA-seq samples in different tissues and early somatic embryogenesis of longan. 
      Phylogenetic analysis showed that the genes with similar gene structure and motif 
      distribution were clustered in the same group. Cis-element identification indicates 
      the possible role of NAC genes in biological and physiological processes. 
      Protein-protein interaction identified the DlNACs homologous with Arabidopsis 
      proteins. We further investigated the expression pattern of DlNAC genes in different 
      tissues (pulp, stem, large fruit, young fruit, and flower) during somatic 
      embryogenesis at embryogenic callus (EC), incomplete compact pro-embryogenic 
      cultures (ICpEC), and globular embryos (GE) stages. The qRT-PCR results showed that 
      the DlNAC genes were expressed higher at EC and GE stage compared with ICpEC stage. 
      In conclusion, our results provide insight into the evolution, diversity, and 
      characterization of NAC genes in the longan and provide a base for understanding 
      their biological roles and molecular mechanisms in plants.

TI  - Introducing a hybrid artificial intelligence method for high-throughput modeling and 
      optimizing plant tissue culture processes: the establishment of a new embryogenesis 
      medium for chrysanthemum, as a case study.
PG  - 10249-10263

AB  - Data-driven models in a combination of optimization algorithms could be beneficial 
      methods for predicting and optimizing in vitro culture processes. This study was 
      aimed at modeling and optimizing a new embryogenesis medium for chrysanthemum. Three 
      individual data-driven models, including multi-layer perceptron (MLP), adaptive 
      neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and support vector regression (SVR), were 
      developed for callogenesis rate (CR), embryogenesis rate (ER), and somatic embryo 
      number (SEN). Consequently, the best obtained results were used in the fusion 
      process by a bagging method. For medium reformulation, effects of eight ionic 
      macronutrients on CR, ER, and SEN and effects of four vitamins on SEN were evaluated 
      using data fusion (DF)-non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) and 
      DF-genetic algorithm (GA), respectively. Results showed that DF models with the 
      highest R(2) had superb performance in comparison with all other individual models. 
      According to DF-NSGAII, the highest ER and SEN can be obtained from the medium 
      containing 14.27 mM NH(4)(+), 38.92 mM NO(3)(-), 22.79 mM K(+), 5.08 mM Cl(-), 
      3.34 mM Ca(2+), 1.67 mM Mg(2+), 2.17 mM SO(4)(2-), and 1.44 mM H(2)PO(4)(-). Based 
      on the DF-GA model, the maximum SEN can be obtained from a medium containing 0.61 μM 
      thiamine, 5.93 μM nicotinic acid, 0.25 μM biotin, and 0.26 μM riboflavin. The 
      efficiency of the established-optimized medium was experimentally compared to 
      Murashige and Skoog medium (MS) for embryogenesis of five chrysanthemum cultivars, 
      and results indicated the efficiency of optimized medium over MS medium.Key points• 
      MLP, SVR, and ANFIS were fused by a bagging method to develop a data fusion model.• 
      NSGA-II and GA were linked to the data fusion model for establishing and optimizing 
      a new embryogenesis medium.• The new culture medium (HNT) had better efficiency than 
      MS medium.

AB  - MicroRNA166 (miR166) contributes to post-transcriptional regulation by binding the 
      mRNAs of HD-ZIP III genes, which affects plant growth and development. The 
      structural characteristics, expression, and functions of miR166 genes during the 
      early somatic embryogenesis stage in Dimocarpus longan remain unknown. We isolated 
      the transcripts of pri-miR166 S78 with two transcription initiation sites (TSSs) and 
      pri-miR166 S338 with one TSS. These sequences contain potential smORFs and encode 
      different miRNA peptides (miPEPs). Additionally, their promoters contain cis-acting 
      elements responsive to diverse stimuli. The pre-miR166 S78 and pre-miR166 S338 
      expression levels were up-regulated in response to 2,4-D, abscisic acid, and 
      ethylene. Although the expression patterns induced by hormones were similar, there 
      were differences in the extent of the response, with pre-miR166 S338 more responsive 
      than pre-miR166 S78. Thus, miRNA transcription and maturation are not simply 
      linearly correlated. Moreover, pre-miR166 S78 and pre-miR166 S338 expression levels 
      were down-regulated, whereas ATHB15 (target gene) expression was up-regulated, from 
      the longan embryonic callus to the globular embryo stages. These results are 
      indicative of a negative regulatory relationship between miR166 and ATHB15 during 
      the early somatic embryogenesis stage in longan. At the same stages, 
      miR166a.2-agomir, miR166a.2-antagomir, and miPEP166 S338 increased or decreased the 
      expression of miR166a.2 and ATHB15, but with no consistent patterns or linear 
      synchronization, from which we've found some reasons for it.

AB  - Emblica officinalis Gaertn. syn. Phyllanthus emblica L., universally known as 'Amla' 
      or 'Aonla' or 'Indian gooseberry', is a popular fruit tree belonging to the family 
      Euphorbiaceae and order Geraniales. It is said to be the very first tree that 
      originated on earth, as claimed by age-old Indian mythology. Almost all parts of the 
      tree i.e., root, bark, leaf, flower, fruit and seed are utilized in Ayurvedic and 
      Unani medicinal formulations to improve the overall digestive process, decrease 
      fever, act as a blood purifier, relieve asthma and cough, improve heart health, etc. 
      This tree contains major secondary metabolites like emblicanin-A and emblicanin-B, 
      and also is an affluent source of vitamin-C. Additionally, some other secondary 
      metabolites like tannins, gallic acid, pyrogallol, and pectin are also present in 
      significant amounts. Conventional propagation has been improved via suitable 
      interventions of agrotechnology both in production and protection areas. However, 
      the rate of propagation remains slower; therefore, attempts have been made for 
      biotechnological advancements on E. officinalis. The present review makes an attempt 
      to highlight the botanical description, geographical distribution, 
      ethnopharmacological importance, conventional propagation and protection of this 
      medicinal tree, describing the in vitro-based plant organ and tissue culture methods 
      like direct and indirect organogenesis and somatic embryogenesis along with 
      interventions of molecular marker-based biotechnology and nanotechnology. Further, 
      the prospect of the yet-to-be-explored biotechnological methods for secondary 
      metabolite enhancement like cell suspension, protoplast culture, genetic 
      transformation, etc. and their potential for enhanced emblicanin production have 
      also been discussed in this appraisal.

AB  - Peppers have a prominent role in traditional cuisine of many different countries all 
      around the world. This is why pepper is one of the most important crops worldwide. 
      Production of doubled haploid (DH) pepper plants has been assessed by different 
      approaches, but at present, the most efficient and universal method is by far anther 
      culture, based on the use of the Dumas de Vaulx et al. protocol published in 1981, 
      and adapted to the particularities of each specific pepper background. In this 
      chapter, we present a method to produce pepper DHs by anther culture, based on the 
      Dumas de Vaulx et al. protocol, but including a number of modifications which, in 
      our experience, allow for a more efficient production DH plants in different pepper 
      genotypes.

TI  - Somatic Embryo Yield and Quality From Norway Spruce Embryogenic Tissue Proliferated 
      in Suspension Culture.
PG  - 791549

AB  - Somatic embryogenesis is being piloted for the commercial production of genetically 
      improved Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst) forest regeneration material in 
      Finland. The main challenge to making the process commercially relevant is the 
      dependence on time-consuming and highly skilled manual labor. Automation and scaling 
      up are needed to improve cost-effectiveness. Moving from the proliferation of 
      embryogenic tissue on semisolid media to suspension cultures could improve process 
      scalability. In a series of four experiments (overall, with 20 cell lines, 4-9 per 
      experiment), the suitability of proliferation in suspension culture for Norway 
      spruce somatic embryogenesis was evaluated based on the growth rate, indicators of 
      stress conditions, good-quality cotyledonary embryo yield, and embling survival in a 
      greenhouse. The proliferation rate in suspension was found equal to on semisolid 
      media, but with a remarkable genotypic variation. Embryogenic tissue matured 
      directly without pre-treatments from suspension onto semisolid media produced lower 
      numbers of good-quality embryos than tissue matured from semisolid media. Rinsing 
      the suspension-grown tissue with hormone-free liquid media before maturation 
      improved embryo yield, bringing it closer to that of semisolid-grown tissue. 
      Decreasing 6-benzylaminopurine and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid concentrations in 
      suspension proliferation media to 0.5 or 0.1 times those in semisolid media did not 
      affect tissue growth and did not improve embryo production. The hydrogen peroxide 
      (H(2)O(2)) content and guaiacol peroxidase activity were elevated in suspension 
      cultures compared with semisolid medium, which had the same plant growth regulator 
      content. In one experiment out of four, the greenhouse survival of germinants was 
      lower when proliferation was carried out in full strength suspension than on 
      semisolid media; in other experiments the survival rates were equal.

AB  - The Sm proteins are a conserved protein family with Sm motifs. The family includes 
      Sm and Sm-like proteins, which play important roles in pre-mRNA splicing. Most 
      research on the Sm proteins have been conducted in herbaceous plants, and less in 
      woody plants such as Dimocarpus longan (longan). And the embryo development status 
      significantly affects the quality and yield of longan. In this study, we conducted a 
      genome-wide analysis of longan Sm genes (DlSm) to clarify their roles during somatic 
      embryogenesis (SE) and identified 29 Sm genes. Phylogenetic analysis deduced longan 
      Sm proteins clustered into 17 phylogenetic groups with the homologous Sm proteins of 
      Arabidopsis thaliana. We also analyzed the gene structures, motif compositions, and 
      conserved domains of the longan Sm proteins. The promoter sequences of the DlSm 
      genes contained many light, endosperm development, hormone, and temperature response 
      elements, which suggested their possible functions. In the non-embryogenic 
      callus(NEC) and during early SE in longan, the alternative splicing(AS) events of 
      DlSm genes indicated that these genes may influence SE development by changing gene 
      structures and sequences. The kinetin(KT) hormone, and blue and white light 
      treatments affected the differentiation and growth of longan embryonic callus(EC) 
      probably by affecting the AS events of DlSm genes. Expression profiles showed the 
      possible functional divergence among Sm genes, and different hormones and light 
      qualities affected their expression levels. The expression trends of the DlSm genes 
      determined by RNA sequencing as fragments per kilobase of exon model per million 
      mapped reads (FPKM) and by real-time quantitative PCR(qRT-PCR) during early SE in 
      longan showed that the expression of the DlSm genes was affected by the growth and 
      differentiation of longan SE, and decreased as the somatic embryo differentiation 
      progressed. The results will contributed to understanding the longan Sm gene family 
      and provide a basis for future functional validation studies.

AB  - For a long time, Cannabis sativa has been used for therapeutic and industrial 
      purposes. Due to its increasing demand in medicine, recreation, and industry, there 
      is a dire need to apply new biotechnological tools to introduce new genotypes with 
      desirable traits and enhanced secondary metabolite production. Micropropagation, 
      conservation, cell suspension culture, hairy root culture, polyploidy manipulation, 
      and Agrobacterium-mediated gene transformation have been studied and used in 
      cannabis. However, some obstacles such as the low rate of transgenic plant 
      regeneration and low efficiency of secondary metabolite production in hairy root 
      culture and cell suspension culture have restricted the application of these 
      approaches in cannabis. In the current review, in vitro culture and genetic 
      engineering methods in cannabis along with other promising techniques such as 
      morphogenic genes, new computational approaches, clustered regularly interspaced 
      short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), CRISPR/Cas9-equipped Agrobacterium-mediated 
      genome editing, and hairy root culture, that can help improve gene transformation 
      and plant regeneration, as well as enhance secondary metabolite production, have 
      been highlighted and discussed.

TI  - Genome-wide investigation of DNA methylation dynamics reveals a critical role of DNA 
      demethylation during the early somatic embryogenesis of Dimocarpus longan Lour.
PG  - 1807-1826
LID - 10.1093/treephys/tpaa097 [doi]
AB  - DNA methylation plays essential roles in gene regulation, chromatin structure 
      stability, gene imprinting, X chromosome inactivation and embryonic development. 
      However, the dynamics and functions of DNA methylation during the early stage of 
      longan (Dimocarpus longan) somatic embryogenesis (SE) are still unclear. In this 
      study, we carried out whole genome bisulphite sequencing and transcriptome 
      sequencing analyses for embryogenic callus (EC), incomplete compact pro-embryogenic 
      cultures (ICpEC) and globular embryos (GE) in an early SE system. At a global level, 
      the DNA 5-methylcytosine content in EC, ICpEC and GE was 24.59, 19.65 and 19.74%, 
      respectively, suggesting a global decrease in DNA methylation from EC to ICpEC and 
      then a slight increase from ICpEC to GE. Differentially methylated region (DMR) 
      analysis showed that hypomethylation mainly occurred in CHH contexts. Gene ontology 
      and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes analysis of 
      hypomethylated-CHH-DMR-associated genes revealed that zein biosynthesis, fatty acid 
      biosynthesis, circadian rhythm and mitophagy pathways were involved in longan early 
      SE. Expression patterns of DNA methyltransferase and demethylase genes during longan 
      early SE suggested that the decrease in DNA methylation was probably regulated by 
      DNA methyltransferase genes and the DNA demethylase gene REPRESSOR OF SILENCING 1 
      (ROS1). The correlation between DNA hypomethylation and gene expression revealed 
      that decreased DNA methylation did not cause extensive changes in gene expression 
      during early longan SE and that gene expression may be affected by methylation 
      changes in gene and downstream regions. Inhibiting DNA methylation with 
      5-azacytidine treatment in EC promoted the formation of GE and enhanced the 
      capability of longan SE. Our results suggest that DNA demethylation has important 
      roles in longan SE development.

AB  - Changes in the composition of the cell walls are postulated to accompany changes in 
      the cell's fate. We check whether there is a relationship between the presence of 
      selected pectic, arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs), and extensins epitopes and changes 
      in cell reprogramming in order to answer the question of whether they can be markers 
      accompanying changes of cell fate. Selected antibodies were used for spatio-temporal 
      immunolocalization of wall components during the induction of somatic embryogenesis. 
      Based on the obtained results, it can be concluded that (1) the LM6 (pectic), LM2 
      (AGPs) epitopes are positive markers, but the LM5, LM19 (pectic), JIM8, JIM13 (AGPs) 
      epitopes are negative markers of cells reprogramming to the meristematic/pluripotent 
      state; (2) the LM8 (pectic), JIM8, JIM13, LM2 (AGPs) and JIM11 (extensin) epitopes 
      are positive markers, but LM6 (pectic) epitope is negative marker of cells 
      undergoing detachment; (3) JIM4 (AGPs) is a positive marker, but LM5 (pectic), JIM8, 
      JIM13, LM2 (AGPs) are negative markers for pericycle cells on the xylem pole; (4) 
      LM19, LM20 (pectic), JIM13, LM2 (AGPs) are constitutive wall components, but LM6, 
      LM8 (pectic), JIM4, JIM8, JIM16 (AGPs), JIM11, JIM12 and JIM20 (extensins) are not 
      constitutive wall components; (5) the extensins do not contribute to the cell 
      reprogramming.

TI  - Hypermethylation of Auxin-Responsive Motifs in the Promoters of the Transcription 
      Factor Genes Accompanies the Somatic Embryogenesis Induction in Arabidopsis.
LID - 10.3390/ijms21186849 [doi]
LID - 6849
AB  - The auxin-induced embryogenic reprogramming of plant somatic cells is associated 
      with extensive modulation of the gene expression in which epigenetic modifications, 
      including DNA methylation, seem to play a crucial role. However, the function of DNA 
      methylation, including the role of auxin in epigenetic regulation of the 
      SE-controlling genes, remains poorly understood. Hence, in the present study, we 
      analysed the expression and methylation of the TF genes that play a critical 
      regulatory role during SE induction (LEC1, LEC2, BBM, WUS and AGL15) in 
      auxin-treated explants of Arabidopsis. The results showed that auxin treatment 
      substantially affected both the expression and methylation patterns of the 
      SE-involved TF genes in a concentration-dependent manner. The auxin treatment 
      differentially modulated the methylation of the promoter (P) and gene body (GB) 
      sequences of the SE-involved genes. Relevantly, the SE-effective auxin treatment 
      (5.0 µM of 2,4-D) was associated with the stable hypermethylation of the P regions 
      of the SE-involved genes and a significantly higher methylation of the P than the GB 
      fragments was a characteristic feature of the embryogenic culture. The presence of 
      auxin-responsive (AuxRE) motifs in the hypermethylated P regions suggests that auxin 
      might substantially contribute to the DNA methylation-mediated control of the 
      SE-involved genes.

AB  - Somatic embryogenesis is an important and wonderful biotechnological tool used to 
      develop whole plant from a single or a group of somatic cells. The differentiated 
      somatic cells become totipotent stem cells by drastic reprogramming of a wide range 
      of cellular activities, leading to the acquisition of embryogenic competence. After 
      acquiring competence, the cells pass through globular, heart, torpedo and 
      cotyledonary stages of embryo; however, all advanced embryos do not convert into 
      full plant, produce adventive embryos or callus instead, thus reverses the 
      programming. This is a big limitation in propagation of many plants. Understanding 
      and unraveling the proteins at this 'embryo to plantlet' transition stage will help 
      to get more numbers of plants. Thus, our study was aimed at an identification of 
      differentially abundant proteins between two important advanced stages, i.e. 
      cotyledonary-(T1) and maturation stage (T2) of somatic embryos in Catharanthus 
      roseus. A total of 2949 and 3030 proteins were identified in cotyledonary and 
      maturation stage, respectively. Of these, 1129 proteins were common to both. Several 
      proteins were found to be differentially accumulated in two different embryo stages 
      in which over 60 proteins were most accumulated during somatic embryo maturation 
      time. More chlorophyll accumulation was noted at this time under the influence of 
      gibberellic acid (GA(3)). Proteins like Mg-protoporphyrin IX chelatase, chlorophyll 
      a-b-binding protein, photosystem I iron-sulfur center, photosystem II Psb, 
      photosystem II subunit P-1, P-II domain-containing protein, RuBisCO large chain, 
      RuBisCO small chain, RuBisCO activase, RuBisCO large subunit-binding proteins were 
      synthesized. Some of the identified proteins are linked to chlorophyll synthesis, 
      carbohydrate metabolism and stress. The identified proteins are categorized into 
      different groups on the basis of their cellular location, role and other metabolic 
      processes. Biochemical attributes like protein, sugar, proline, antioxidant enzyme 
      (APX, SOD and CAT) activities were high in T2 as compared to T1. The proteins like 
      peroxidases, pathogenesis-related proteins, the late-embryogenesis abundant 
      proteins, argonaute, germin and others have been discussed in C. roseus somatic 
      embryo maturation process.

AB  - High variability in somatic embryo (SE)-forming capacity has previously been 
      observed in several spinach cultivars. Such variability frequently accounted for 
      more variation in embryogenic response of the explants than the factor being 
      investigated. Hence, the variability in embryogenic capacity was examined in the 
      present study at both the population and the single-seedling level, using seeds of 
      spinach cultivar Matador obtained from nine European seed companies. Seed population 
      obtained from Slovenia (Sl) was superior to others, with the highest regeneration 
      frequency (100%) and the highest mean SE number (14.4). A total of 82% of these 
      seedlings had 80-100% of regenerating explants, while in populations with 
      intermediate embryogenic capacity approximately 40% of seedlings had 20-60% of 
      regenerating explants. The explants from the majority of seedlings (52-100%) in the 
      least responsive populations were irresponsive. Furthermore, the explants from Sl 
      seedlings regenerated from 10-20 (43.5%) up to > 20 (27.6%) SEs on average, while 
      the explants from the majority of seedlings belonging to other populations 
      regenerated 1-10 SEs. The present study strongly indicates that the variability of 
      plant material must not be overlooked, because choosing more responsive individuals 
      for one treatment and less responsive ones for another may lead to misinterpretation 
      of the data.

      typically lose their capacity to redifferentiate cells that are already fully 
      differentiated, plant cells are thought to remain totipotent (Su et al., 2020). 
      Every gardener knows well that plants can regenerate a full array of plant tissues 
      from already differentiated organs. This also seems to be true for single plant 
      cells such as protoplasts, which, under proper in vitro culture conditions, served 
      as the initial source for generation of transgenic plants (Skoog and Miller, 1957; 
      Birnbaum and Sánchez Alvarado, 2008). However, the mechanisms behind the totipotency 
      of plant cells remain elusive, with the exception of the knowledge that the 
      developmental fate of regenerating tissues can be directed by the ratio of two plant 
      hormones, auxin and cytokinin (Skoog and Miller, 1957).

TI  - Symplasmic Isolation Contributes to Somatic Embryo Induction and Development in the 
      Tree Fern Cyathea delgadii Sternb.

LID - 10.1093/pcp/pcaa058 [doi]
AB  - In this report, we describe studies on symplasmic communication and cellular 
      rearrangement during direct somatic embryogenesis (SE) in the tree fern Cyathea 
      delgadii. We analyzed changes in the symplasmic transport of low-molecular-weight 
      fluorochromes, such as 8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid, trisodium salt (HPTS) 
      and fluorescein (delivered to cells as fluorescein diacetate, FDA), within stipe 
      explants and somatic embryos originating from single epidermal cells and developing 
      during 16-d long culture. Induction of SE is preceded by a restriction in 
      fluorochrome distribution between certain explant cells. Microscopic analysis showed 
      a series of cellular changes like a decrease in vacuole size, increase in vacuole 
      numbers, and increased density of cytoplasm and deposition of electron-dense 
      material in cell walls that may be related with embryogenic transition. In somatic 
      embryos, the limited symplasmic communication between cells was observed first in 
      linear tri-cellular embryos. Further development of the fern embryo was associated 
      with the formation of symplasmic domains corresponding to the four segments of the 
      plant body. Using symplasmic tracers, we provided evidence that the changes in 
      plasmodesmata permeability are corelated with somatic-to-embryogenic transition and 
      somatic embryo development.

TI  - Applications of Cytokinins in Horticultural Fruit Crops: Trends and Future 
      Prospects.
LID - 10.3390/biom10091222 [doi]
LID - 1222
AB  - Cytokinins (CKs) are a chemically diverse class of plant growth regulators, 
      exhibiting wide-ranging actions on plant growth and development, hence their 
      exploitation in agriculture for crop improvement and management. Their coordinated 
      regulatory effects and cross-talk interactions with other phytohormones and 
      signaling networks are highly sophisticated, eliciting and controlling varied 
      biological processes at the cellular to organismal levels. In this review, we 
      briefly introduce the mode of action and general molecular biological effects of 
      naturally occurring CKs before highlighting the great variability in the response of 
      fruit crops to CK-based innovations. We present a comprehensive compilation of 
      research linked to the application of CKs in non-model crop species in different 
      phases of fruit production and management. By doing so, it is clear that the effects 
      of CKs on fruit set, development, maturation, and ripening are not necessarily 
      generic, even for cultivars within the same species, illustrating the magnitude of 
      yet unknown intricate biochemical and genetic mechanisms regulating these processes 
      in different fruit crops. Current approaches using genomic-to-metabolomic analysis 
      are providing new insights into the in planta mechanisms of CKs, pinpointing the 
      underlying CK-derived actions that may serve as potential targets for improving 
      crop-specific traits and the development of new solutions for the preharvest and 
      postharvest management of fruit crops. Where information is available, CK molecular 
      biology is discussed in the context of its present and future implications in the 
      applications of CKs to fruits of horticultural significance.

TI  - Methylation Analysis of CpG Islands in Pineapple SERK1 Promoter.
LID - 10.3390/genes11040425 [doi]
LID - 425
AB  - Somatic embryogenesis (SE) is a more rapid and controllable method for plant 
      propagation than traditional breeding methods. However, it often suffers from 
      limited efficiency. SERK1 promotes SE in several plants, including pineapple (Ananas 
      comosus L.). We investigate the embryonic cell-specific transcriptional regulation 
      of AcSERK1 by methylation analysis of CpG islands in AcSERK1 regulatory sequences. 
      This revealed differences in the methylation status of CpG islands between embryonic 
      callus and non-embryonic callus; the methylation inhibitor 5-azaC increased AcSERK1 
      expression and also accelerated SE. These findings indicate that the expression of 
      AcSERK1 is regulated epigenetically. This study lays the foundation for further 
      analysis of epigenetic regulatory mechanisms that may enhance the efficiency of SE 
      in pineapple and other plants.

TI  - The Effect of Daminozide, Dark/Light Schedule and Copper Sulphate in Tissue Culture 
      of Triticum timopheevii.
LID - 10.3390/plants10122620 [doi]
LID - 2620
AB  - Triticum timopheevii Zhuk. is a tetraploid wheat that is utilized worldwide as a 
      valuable breeding source for wheat improvement. Gene-based biotechnologies can 
      contribute to this field; however, T. timopheevii exhibits recalcitrance and 
      albinism in tissue cultures, making this species of little use for manipulation 
      through genetic engineering and genome editing. This study tested various approaches 
      to increasing in vitro somatic embryogenesis and plant regeneration, while reducing 
      the portion of albinos in cultures derived from immature embryos (IEs) of T. 
      timopheevii. They included (i) adjusting the balance between 2,4-D and daminozide in 
      callus induction medium; (ii) cultivation using various darkness/illumination 
      schedules; and (iii) inclusion of additional concentrations of copper ions in the 
      tissue culture medium. We achieved a 2.5-fold increase in somatic embryogenesis (up 
      to 80%) when 50 mg L(-1) daminozide was included in the callus induction medium 
      together with 3 mg L(-1) 2,4-D. It was found that the dark cultivation for 20-30 
      days was superior in terms of achieving maximum culture efficiency; moreover, 
      switching to light in under 2 weeks from culture initiation significantly increased 
      the number of albino plants, suppressed somatic embryogenesis, and decreased the 
      regeneration of green plants. Media containing higher levels of copper ions did not 
      have a positive effect on the regeneration of green plants; contrarily, the elevated 
      concentrations caused albinism in plantlets. The results and relevant conclusions of 
      the present study might be valuable for establishing an improved protocol for the 
      regeneration of green plants in tissue cultures of T. timopheevii.

AB  - Plant embryogenic cell culture allows mass propagation and genetic manipulation, but 
      the mechanisms that determine the fate of these totipotent cells in somatic embryos 
      have not yet been elucidated. Here, we performed label-free quantitative proteomics 
      and phosphoproteomics analyses to determine signaling events related to sugarcane 
      somatic embryo differentiation, especially those related to protein phosphorylation. 
      Embryogenic calli were compared at multiplication (EC0, dedifferentiated cells) and 
      after 14 days of maturation (EC14, onset of embryo differentiation). Metabolic 
      pathway analysis showed enriched lysine degradation and starch/sucrose metabolism 
      proteins during multiplication, whereas the differentiation of somatic embryos was 
      found to involve the enrichment of energy metabolism, including the TCA cycle and 
      oxidative phosphorylation. Multiplication-related phosphoproteins were associated 
      with transcriptional regulation, including SNF1 kinase homolog 10 (KIN10), SEUSS 
      (SEU), and LEUNIG_HOMOLOG (LUH). The regulation of multiple light harvesting complex 
      photosystem II proteins and phytochrome interacting factor 3-LIKE 5 were predicted 
      to promote bioenergetic metabolism and carbon fixation during the maturation stage. 
      A motif analysis revealed 15 phosphorylation motifs. The [D-pS/T-x-D] motif was 
      overrepresented during somatic embryo differentiation. A protein-protein network 
      analysis predicted interactions among SNF1-related protein kinase 2 (SnRK2), 
      abscisic acid-responsive element-binding factor 2 (ABF2), and KIN10, which indicated 
      the role of these proteins in embryogenic competence. The predicted interactions 
      between TOPLESS (TPL) and histone deacetylase 19 (HD19) may be involved in 
      posttranslational protein regulation during somatic embryo differentiation. These 
      results reveal the protein regulation dynamics of somatic embryogenesis and new 
      players in somatic embryo differentiation, including their predicted phosphorylation 
      motifs and phosphosites.

TI  - ABA signalling promotes cell totipotency in the shoot apex of germinating embryos.
PG  - 6418-6436
LID - 10.1093/jxb/erab306 [doi]
AB  - Somatic embryogenesis (SE) is a type of induced cell totipotency where embryos 
      develop from vegetative tissues of the plant instead of from gamete fusion after 
      fertilization. SE can be induced in vitro by exposing explants to growth regulators, 
      such as the auxinic herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). The plant 
      hormone abscisic acid (ABA) has been proposed to be a downstream signalling 
      component at the intersection between 2,4-D- and stress-induced SE, but it is not 
      known how these pathways interact to induce cell totipotency. Here we show that 
      2,4-D-induced SE from the shoot apex of germinating Arabidopsis thaliana seeds is 
      characterized by transcriptional maintenance of an ABA-dependent seed maturation 
      pathway. Molecular-genetic analysis of Arabidopsis mutants revealed a role for ABA 
      in promoting SE at three different levels: ABA biosynthesis, ABA receptor complex 
      signalling, and ABA-mediated transcription, with essential roles for the ABSCISIC 
      ACID INSENSITIVE 3 (ABI3) and ABI4 transcription factors. Our data suggest that the 
      ability of mature Arabidopsis embryos to maintain the ABA seed maturation 
      environment is an important first step in establishing competence for auxin-induced 
      cell totipotency. This finding provides further support for the role of ABA in 
      directing processes other than abiotic stress response.

TI  - Genetic Transformation in Peach (Prunus persica L.): Challenges and Ways Forward.
LID - 10.3390/plants9080971 [doi]
LID - 971
AB  - Almost 30 years have passed since the first publication reporting regeneration of 
      transformed peach plants. Nevertheless, the general applicability of genetic 
      transformation of this species has not yet been established. Many strategies have 
      been tested in order to obtain an efficient peach transformation system. Despite the 
      amount of time and the efforts invested, the lack of success has significantly 
      limited the utility of peach as a model genetic system for trees, despite its 
      relatively short generation time; small, high-quality genome; and well-studied 
      genetic resources. Additionally, the absence of efficient genetic transformation 
      protocols precludes the application of many biotechnological tools in peach breeding 
      programs. In this review, we provide an overview of research on regeneration and 
      genetic transformation in this species and summarize novel strategies and procedures 
      aimed at producing transgenic peaches. Promising future approaches to develop a 
      robust peach transformation system are discussed, focusing on the main bottlenecks 
      to success including the low efficiency of A. tumefaciens-mediated transformation, 
      the low level of correspondence between cells competent for transformation and those 
      that have regenerative competence, and the high rate of chimerism in the few shoots 
      that are produced following transformation.

AB  - Reprogramming of primary virus-infected cells is the critical step that turns viral 
      attacks harmful to humans by initiating super-spreading at cell, organism and 
      population levels. To develop early anti-viral therapies and proactive 
      administration, it is important to understand the very first steps of this process. 
      Plant somatic embryogenesis (SE) is the earliest and most studied model for de novo 
      programming upon severe stress that, in contrast to virus attacks, promotes 
      individual cell and organism survival. We argued that transcript level profiles of 
      target genes established from in vitro SE induction as reference compared to 
      virus-induced profiles can identify differential virus traits that link to harmful 
      reprogramming. To validate this hypothesis, we selected a standard set of genes 
      named 'ReprogVirus'. This approach was recently applied and published. It resulted 
      in identifying 'CoV-MAC-TED', a complex trait that is promising to support combating 
      SARS-CoV-2-induced cell reprogramming in primary infected nose and mouth cells. In 
      this perspective, we aim to explain the rationale of our scientific approach. We are 
      highlighting relevant background knowledge on SE, emphasize the role of alternative 
      oxidase in plant reprogramming and resilience as a learning tool for designing human 
      virus-defense strategies and, present the list of selected genes. As an outlook, we 
      announce wider data collection in a 'ReprogVirus Platform' to support anti-viral 
      strategy design through common efforts.

AB  - This study describes critical factors affecting germination of somatic embryos and 
      plantlet regeneration in Pinus massoniana. Somatic embryos from the same embryogenic 
      line 27 of P. massoniana were used as test materials. The supplementation of 
      activated charcoal (AC) in the medium was essential for the germination of mature 
      somatic embryos, while the addition of excessive AC to the medium was prohibitive 
      for somatic embryo germination. The highest germination rate was found on the medium 
      containing 10 g/l AC, and the addition of 5 g/l AC to the medium was optimal to the 
      growth of germinating somatic embryos. Thidiazuron (TDZ) was linearly related to the 
      number of sprouting axillary buds. However, the growth of sprouting buds was 
      retarded when > 4 µmol/l TDZ was added into culture medium. Exogenous plant growth 
      regulators added to the medium significantly improved the root regeneration capacity 
      of shoots. The highest root regeneration rate was observed under the treatment of 
      1.2 µmol/l ɑ-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) plus 2 µmol/l paclobutrazol (PBZ), 
      reaching 96.3%. One year after the field transfer, the growth performance of plant 
      height, caliper, and survival rate for rooted shoots was significantly better than 
      that of plantlets directly developed via somatic embryogenesis. The presented 
      results provide useful instruction for the establishment of plantlets originating 
      from somatic embryos, and would be able to make a great contribution to the clonal 
      forestry of P. massoniana.

TI  - Improved cotton transformation protocol mediated by Agrobacterium and biolistic 
      combined-methods.
PG  - 20

AB  - The combined Agrobacterium- and biolistic-mediated methods of cotton transformation 
      provide a straightforward and highly efficient protocol for obtaining transgenic 
      cotton. Cotton (Gossypium spp.) is the most important crop for natural textile fiber 
      production worldwide. Nonetheless, one of the main challenges in cotton production 
      are the losses resulting from insect pests, pathogens, and abiotic stresses. One 
      effective way to solve these issues is to use genetically modified (GM) varieties. 
      Herein, we describe an improved protocol for straightforward and cost-effective 
      genetic transformation of cotton embryo axes, merging biolistics and Agrobacterium. 
      The experimental steps include (1) Agrobacterium preparation, (2) seed 
      sterilization, (3) cotton embryo excision, (4) lesion of shoot-cells by tungsten 
      bombardment, (5) Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, (6) embryo co-culture, (7) 
      regeneration and selection of transgenic plants in vitro, and (8) molecular 
      characterization of plants. Due to the high regenerative power of the embryonic axis 
      and the exceptional ability of the meristem cells for plant regeneration through 
      organogenesis in vitro, this protocol can be performed in approximately 4-10 weeks, 
      with an average plant regeneration of about 5.5% (± 0.53) and final average 
      transformation efficiency of 60% (± 0.55). The transgene was stably inherited, and 
      most transgenic plants hold a single copy of the transgene, as desirable and 
      expected in Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Additionally, the transgene was 
      stably expressed over generations, and transgenic proteins could be detected at high 
      levels in the T(2) generation of GM cotton plants. The T(2) progeny showed no 
      phenotypic or productivity disparity compared to wild-type plants. Collectively, the 
      use of cotton embryo axes and the enhanced DNA-delivery system by combining particle 
      bombardment and Agrobacterium infection enabled efficient transgenic plant recovery, 
      overcoming usual limitations associated with the recalcitrance of several cotton 
      genotypes subjected to somatic embryogenesis. The improved approach states this 
      method's success for cotton genetic modification, allowing us to obtain GM cotton 
      plants carrying traits, which are of fundamental relevance for the advancement of 
      global agribusiness.

LID - e0235525
AB  - Cannabis sativa is relatively recalcitrant to de novo regeneration, but several 
      studies have reported shoot organogenesis or somatic embryogenesis from 
      non-meristematic tissues. Most report infrequent regeneration rates from these 
      tissues, but a landmark publication from 2010 achieved regeneration from leaf 
      explants with a 96% response rate, producing an average of 12.3 shoots per explant 
      in a single drug-type accession. Despite the importance regeneration plays in plant 
      biotechnology and the renewed interest in this crop the aforementioned protocol has 
      not been used in subsequent papers in the decade since it was published, raising 
      concerns over its reproducibility. Here we attempted to replicate this important 
      Cannabis regeneration study and expand the original scope of the study by testing it 
      across 10 drug-type C. sativa genotypes to assess genotypic variation. In our study, 
      callus was induced in all 10 genotypes but callus growth and appearance 
      substantially differed among cultivars, with the most responsive genotype producing 
      6-fold more callus than the least responsive. The shoot induction medium failed to 
      induce shoot organogenesis in any of the 10 cultivars tested, instead resulting in 
      necrosis of the calli. The findings of this replication study raise concerns about 
      the replicability of existing methods. However, some details of the protocol could 
      not be replicated due to missing details in the original paper and regulatory 
      issues, which could have impacted the outcome. These results highlight the 
      importance of using multiple genotypes in such studies and providing detailed 
      methods to facilitate replication.

AB  - Somatic embryogenesis-mediated plant regeneration is essential for the genetic 
      manipulation of agronomically important traits in upland cotton. Genotype specific 
      recalcitrance to regeneration is a primary challenge in deploying genome editing and 
      incorporating useful transgenes into elite cotton germplasm. In this study, 
      transcriptomes of a semi-recalcitrant cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) genotype 
      'Coker312' were analyzed at two critical stages of somatic embryogenesis that 
      include non-embryogenic callus (NEC) and embryogenic callus (EC) cells, and the 
      results were compared to a non-recalcitrant genotype 'Jin668'. We discovered 305 
      differentially expressed genes in Coker312, whereas, in Jin668, about 6-fold more 
      genes (2155) were differentially expressed. A total of 154 differentially expressed 
      genes were common between the two genotypes. Gene enrichment analysis of the 
      upregulated genes identified functional categories, such as lipid transport, embryo 
      development, regulation of transcription, sugar transport, and vitamin biosynthesis, 
      among others. In Coker312 EC cells, five major transcription factors were highly 
      upregulated: LEAFY&nbsp;COTYLEDON 1 (LEC1), WUS-related homeobox 5 (WOX5), ABSCISIC 
      ACID INSENSITIVE3 (ABI3), FUSCA3 (FUS3), and WRKY2. In Jin668, LEC1, BABY BOOM 
      (BBM), FUS3, and AGAMOUS-LIKE15 (AGL15) were highly expressed in EC cells. We also 
      found that gene expression of these embryogenesis genes was typically higher in 
      Jin668 when compared to Coker312. We conclude that significant differences in the 
      expression of the above genes between Coker312 and Jin668 may be a critical factor 
      affecting the regenerative ability of these genotypes.

AB  - The lower regeneration rate of wheat calli is the main factor restricting the 
      development of transgenic wheat plants. Therefore, improving the regeneration rate 
      of wheat callus is a precondition for developing genetic engineering-based wheat 
      breeding approaches. In the present study, we explored the molecular mechanism of 
      wheat regeneration and aimed to establish an efficient system for transgenic wheat. 
      We isolated and identified a regeneration-related gene, TaTCP-1 (KC808517), from 
      wheat cultivar Lunxuan 987. Sequence analysis revealed that the ORF of TaTCP-1 was 
      1623bp long encoding 540 amino acids. The TaTCP-1 gene was expressed in various 
      wheat tissues. Further, the level of TaTCP-1 expression was higher in calli and 
      increased gradually with increasing callus induction time, reaching a peak on the 
      11th day after induction. Moreover, the expression level of TaTCP-1 was higher in 
      embryogenic calli than in non-embryonic calli. The TaTCP-1 protein was localized to 
      the nucleus, cytoplasm, and cell membrane. The callus regeneration rate of wheat 
      plants transformed with TaTCP-1-RNAi reduced by 85.09%. In contrast, it increased by 
      14.43% in plants overexpressing TaTCP-1. In conclusion, our results showed that 
      TaTCP-1 played a vital role in promoting wheat regeneration, and regulated the 
      somatic embryogenesis of wheat. These results may have implications in the genetic 
      engineering of wheat for improved wheat production.

AB  - Somatic embryogenesis is the process by which bipolar structures with no vascular 
      connection with the surrounding tissue are formed from a single or a group of 
      vegetative cells, and in conifers it can be divided into five different steps: 
      initiation, proliferation, maturation, germination and acclimatization. Somatic 
      embryogenesis has long been used as a model to study the mechanisms regulating 
      stress response in plants, and recent research carried out in our laboratory has 
      demonstrated that high temperatures during initial stages of conifer somatic 
      embryogenesis modify subsequent phases of the process, as well as the behavior of 
      the resulting plants ex vitro. The development of high-throughput techniques has 
      facilitated the study of the molecular response of plants to numerous stress 
      factors. Proteomics offers a reliable image of the cell status and is known to be 
      extremely susceptible to environmental changes. In this study, the proteome of 
      radiata pine somatic embryos was analyzed by LC-MS after the application of high 
      temperatures during initiation of embryonal masses [(23°C, control; 40°C (4 h); 60°C 
      (5 min)]. At the same time, the content of specific soluble sugars and sugar 
      alcohols was analyzed by HPLC. Results confirmed a significant decrease in the 
      initiation rate of embryonal masses under 40°C treatments (from 44 to 30.5%) and an 
      increasing tendency in the production of somatic embryos (from 121.87 to 170.83 
      somatic embryos per gram of embryogenic tissue). Besides, heat provoked a long-term 
      readjustment of the protein synthesis machinery: a great number of structural 
      constituents of ribosomes were increased under high temperatures, together with the 
      down-regulation of the enzyme methionine-tRNA ligase. Heat led to higher contents of 
      heat shock proteins and chaperones, transmembrane transport proteins, proteins 
      related with post-transcriptional regulation (ARGONAUTE 1D) and enzymes involved in 
      the synthesis of fatty acids, specific compatible sugars (myo-inositol) and 
      cell-wall carbohydrates. On the other hand, the protein adenosylhomocysteinase and 
      enzymes linked with the glycolytic pathway, nitrogen assimilation and oxidative 
      stress response were found at lower levels.

AB  - In the present study, an efficient in vitro propagation protocol has been developed 
      from clove explants of Allium sativum L., one of the oldest vegetable and medicinal 
      plant used worldwide. Garlic is propagated vegetatively as cross-fertilization is 
      strictly precluded due to sterile flowers. Due to a low rate of multiplication, 
      limited genetic improvement possibility and increased germplasm degradation, plant 
      tissue culture becomes an efficient and preferred tool for quality and rapid 
      propagation of garlic. Here, the clove explants were cultured on Murashige and Skoog 
      basal medium amended with different concentrations of Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs) 
      namely 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid (2,4-D), 6-benzyl amino purine (BAP), and 
      1-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA). Within 2 weeks of inoculation, white compact callus 
      was formed, maximum callus induction frequency (85.99%) was on 1.5 mg l(-1) 2, 4-D 
      added MS medium. Induced callus transformed into an embryogenic callus on 2, 4-D and 
      BAP amended MS medium with highest embryogenic frequency (77.7%) was noted on 
      0.25 mg l(-1) 2, 4-D and 1.0 mg l(-1) BAP added medium. Embryogenic callus 
      differentiated into progressive stages of somatic embryos starting from globular, 
      scutellar, and finally to coleoptilar stage of the embryo. Histological and scanning 
      electron microscopic study of embryogenic callus was conducted, showing different 
      stages of embryos, their origin and development, re-confirming somatic embryogenesis 
      incidence in A. sativum. Green and mature somatic embryos were germinated and 
      converted into plantlets on 0.5 mg l(-1) BAP amended MS medium. The in vitro 
      regenerated plants were cultured separately in IBA and NAA supplemented media for 
      root induction. The MS medium amended with 1.0 mg l(-1) IBA proved to be the best 
      PGR treatment in inducing roots. The rooted plants were acclimatized and transferred 
      ex vitro with about 87% survival rate. Cytological and flow cytometric analyses were 
      performed to assess the genetic stability of in vitro regenerated plants. 
      Cytological studies of in vitro regenerated plants showed 2n = 16 chromosome number 
      and did not reveal any numerical variation in chromosomes. Flow cytometry was 
      employed to measure the 2C DNA content of somatic embryo regenerated A. sativum 
      plants and compared with in vivo grown garlic. The histogram peaks of relative 2C 
      DNA content of in vitro regenerated plantlets were similar to the corresponding 2C 
      DNA peak of in vivo grown plants. Flow cytometric 2C DNA content of embryo 
      regenerated and field-grown A. sativum plants were the same, i.e., 33.45 pg and 
      33.56 pg, respectively, confirming genetic similarity. In conclusion, the present 
      cytological and flow cytometric study suggest that the in vitro culture conditions 
      are quite safe, did not encourage genetic alterations, and regenerants were "true to 
      type."

AB  - Liriodendron chinense (Lchi) is a Magnoliaceae plant, which is a basic angiosperm 
      left behind by the Pleistocene and mainly distributed in the south of the Yangtze 
      River. Liriodendron hybrids has good wood properties and is widely used in furniture 
      and in other fields. It is not clear if they can adapt to different environmental 
      conditions, such as drought and high and low temperatures, and the molecular 
      mechanisms for this adaptation are unknown. Among plant transcription factors (TFs), 
      the MYB gene family is one of the largest and is often involved in stress or 
      adversity response signaling, growth, and development. Therefore, studying the role 
      of MYBTFs in regulating abiotic stress signaling, growth, and development in Lchi is 
      helpful to promote afforestation in different environments. In our research, a 
      genome-wide analysis of the LchiMYB gene family was performed, including the 
      phylogenetic relationship tree, gene exon-intron structure, collinearity, and 
      chromosomal position. According to the evolutionary tree, 190 LchiMYBs were divided 
      into three main branches. LchiMYBs were evenly distributed across 19 chromosomes, 
      with their collinearity, suggesting that segment duplication events may have 
      contributed to LchiMYB gene expansion. Transcriptomes from eight tissues, 11 stages 
      of somatic embryogenesis, and leaves after cold, heat, and drought stress were used 
      to analyze the function of the MYB gene family. The results of tissue expression 
      analysis showed that most LchiMYB genes regulated bark, leaf, bud, sepal, stigma, 
      and stamen development, as well as the four important stages (ES3, ES4, ES9, and PL) 
      of somatic embryogenesis. More than 60 LchiMYBs responded to heat, cold, and drought 
      stress; some of which underwent gene duplication during evolution. LchiMYB3 was 
      highly expressed under all three forms of stress, while LchiMYB121 was strongly 
      induced by both cold and heat stress. Eight genes with different expression patterns 
      were selected and verified by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) experiments. The 
      results suggested that these LchiMYBs may regulate Lchi growth development and 
      resistance to abiotic stress. This study shows the cross-regulatory function of 
      LchiMYBs in the growth and development, asexual reproduction, and abiotic resistance 
      of Lchi. This information will prove pivotal to directing further studies on the 
      biological function of Lchi MYBTFs in genetic improvement and abiotic stress 
      response.

AB  - Here we present an optimized protocol for in vitro embryo formation and plant 
      regeneration through anther culture of the Mexican husk tomato (Physalis ixocarpa 
      Brot.). This protocol relies on the application of an anther thermal shock at a 
      specific developmental stage prior to the in vitro culture, ensures embryo formation 
      from anthers without callus formation, and allows spending less time to regenerate 
      doubled haploid complete plants. This protocol has been used for different cultivars 
      of Physalis ixocarpa (Chapingo, Rendidora, Puebla, Arandaz, Manzano, Tamazula, 
      Salamanca, and Milpero), and also for two wild-type accessions, all of them 
      cultivated in Mexico. Chapingo cultivar responded with the highest percentage of 
      androgenesis on the embryo induction medium (EIM).

AB  - In this study, we evaluated the potential use of MALDI-TOF MS Profiling for the 
      differentiation of biological samples submitted to different treatments. We compared 
      the bacterium Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc), grown in culture medium 
      and in vivo (recovered from the plant). Plant samples were also analyzed and 
      included explants at different somatic embryogenesis (SE) stages, as well as leaves 
      from Brassica oleracea and Arabidopsis thaliana inoculated with Xcc, at different 
      time points. The results showed that bacteria and highly divergent plant samples, 
      such as those from embryogenic stages, can be unequivocally differentiated and the 
      clustering was in accordance with proteomic analysis performed by 2-DE. These 
      results show an important application of MALDI-TOF MS Profiling to select and 
      prioritize samples to be analyzed prior to more complex approaches including 
      transcriptomics and proteomics. We also show that in plant-pathogen interactions, 
      when more subtle differences are obtained, the main contribution of MALDI-TOF MS 
      Profiling is in the assessment of experimental variability. This is relevant since 
      reproducibility is a challenging issue when dealing with complex experimental 
      conditions such as plant-pathogen interactions. We propose the use of MALDI-TOF MS 
      Profiling to aid researchers in minimizing experimental variability unrelated to the 
      condition being analyzed. SIGNIFICANCE: MALDI-Profiling offers an inexpensive, rapid 
      and reliable approach for investigating the protein profile to assess sample 
      differentiation and experimental variability in microorganisms and plants and can be 
      highly useful to analyze samples prior to more complex and expensive techniques such 
      as proteomics and transcriptomics.

TI  - The Morphoregulatory Role of Thidiazuron: Metabolomics-Guided Hypothesis Generation 
      for Mechanisms of Activity.
LID - 10.3390/biom10091253 [doi]
LID - 1253
AB  - Thidiazuron (TDZ) is a diphenylurea synthetic herbicide and plant growth regulator 
      used to defoliate cotton crops and to induce regeneration of recalcitrant species in 
      plant tissue culture. In vitro cultures of African violet thin petiole sections are 
      an ideal model system for studies of TDZ-induced morphogenesis. TDZ induces de novo 
      shoot organogenesis at low concentrations and somatic embryogenesis at higher 
      concentrations of exposure. We used an untargeted metabolomics approach to identify 
      metabolites in control and TDZ-treated tissues. Statistical analysis including 
      metabolite clustering, pattern and pathway tools, logical algorithms, synthetic 
      biotransformations and hormonomics identified TDZ-induced changes in metabolism. A 
      total of 18,602 putative metabolites with extracted masses and predicted formulae 
      were identified with 1412 features that were found only in TDZ-treated tissues and 
      312 that increased in response to TDZ. The monomer of TDZ was not detected intact in 
      the tissues but putative oligomers were found in the database and we hypothesize 
      that these may form by a Diels-Alder reaction. Accumulation oligomers in the tissue 
      may act as a reservoir, slowly releasing the active TDZ monomer over time. Cleavage 
      of the amide bridge released TDZ-metabolites into the tissues including organic 
      nitrogen and sulfur containing compounds. Metabolomics data analysis generated six 
      novel hypotheses that can be summarized as an overall increase in uptake of sugars 
      from the culture media, increase in primary metabolism, redirection of terpene 
      metabolism and mediation of stress metabolism via indoleamine and phenylpropanoid 
      metabolism. Further research into the specific mechanisms hypothesized is likely to 
      unravel the mode of action of TDZ and to provide new insights into the control of 
      plant morphogenesis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflorescence explants of date palm proved to be a promising tool for 
      micropropagation of elite cultivars or rare males and females as organogenesis and 
      somatic embryogenesis could be achieved. These plant materials are abundantly 
      available every year and can be used as cheap and potent explants. Nevertheless, 
      many difficulties could be faced in this protocol according to selection of the 
      spathe size and age, media components, growth regulators, etc. The aim of this study 
      was to determine the influence of various cytokinins on direct organs induction of 
      three date palm cultivars (Selmi, Barhee, and Medjool) from immature inflorescence. 
      An additional objective of this study was to investigate the effect of cytokinins 
      and auxins on growth and development of Medjool cultivar. RESULTS: Various 
      combinations of cytokinins were investigated on three date palm inflorescences as 
      N6-(2-isopentenyl) adenine (2iP), kinetin, benzyleadenine (BA), and thidiazuron 
      (N-phenyl-N'-1,2,3-thidiazol-5-yl urea) (TDZ). TDZ alone or in combination with BA 
      proved to be superior for direct organogenesis in all three cultivars so that 
      another combination of TDZ with BA was conducted. Results showed that moderate 
      concentration of BA, with TDZ, gave superior response. Medjool cultivar response 
      surpassed other two cultivars that made the possibility to conduct some growth 
      regulators treatments on its multiplication and regeneration. TDZ at 0.5 + BA at 
      1.0 mg/l without activated charcoal seemed to enhance multiplication rate. Medium 
      containing 0.5 mg/l of both naphthaleneacetic acid and indole butyric acid in 
      addition to 1.0 mg/l indole acetic acid appeared to be more suitable for rooting 
      stage of Medjool shootlets. CONCLUSION: In this study, we created an innovation 
      sequence of growth regulators included in nutrient media for date palm direct 
      organogenesis from inflorescence. Organogenesis has been accelerated from immature 
      inflorescence explants and developed to healthy plantlets which acclimatized in 
      greenhouse.

TI  - Transcriptomes and DNA methylomes in apomictic cells delineate nucellar 
      embryogenesis initiation in citrus.
LID - 10.1093/dnares/dsab014 [doi]
LID - dsab014
AB  - Citrus nucellar poly-embryony (NPE) is a mode of sporophytic apomixis that asexual 
      embryos formed in the seed through adventitious embryogenesis from the somatic 
      nucellar cells. NPE allows clonal propagation of rootstocks, but it impedes citrus 
      cross breeding. To understand the cellular processes involved in NPE initiation, we 
      profiled the transcriptomes and DNA methylomes in laser microdissection captured 
      citrus apomictic cells. In apomictic cells, ribosome biogenesis and protein 
      degradation were activated, whereas auxin polar transport was repressed. Reactive 
      oxygen species (ROS) accumulated in the poly-embryonic ovules, and response to 
      oxidative stress was provoked. The global DNA methylation level, especially that of 
      CHH context, was decreased, whereas the methylation level of the NPE-controlling key 
      gene CitRWP was increased. A C2H2 domain-containing transcription factor gene and 
      CitRWP co-expressed specifically in apomictic cells may coordinate to initiate NPE. 
      The activated embryogenic development and callose deposition processes indicated 
      embryogenic fate of nucellar embryo initial (NEI) cells. In our working model for 
      citrus NPE initiation, DNA hyper-methylation may activate transcription of CitRWP, 
      which increases C2H2 expression and ROS accumulation, triggers epigenetic regulation 
      and regulates cell fate transition and NEI cell identity in the apomictic cells.

AB  - The study of somatic embryogenesis can provide insight into early plant development. 
      We previously obtained LaMIR166a-overexpressing embryonic cell lines of Larix 
      kaempferi (Lamb.) Carr. To further elucidate the molecular mechanisms associated 
      with miR166 in this species, the transcriptional profiles of wild-type (WT) and 
      three LaMIR166a-overexpressing transgenic cell lines were subjected to RNA 
      sequencing using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 system. In total, 203,256 unigenes were 
      generated using Trinity de novo assembly, and 2467 differentially expressed genes 
      were obtained by comparing transgenic and WT lines. In addition, we analyzed the 
      cleaved degree of LaMIR166a target genes LaHDZ31-34 in different transgenic cell 
      lines by detecting the expression pattern of LaHdZ31-34, and their cleaved degree in 
      transgenic cell lines was higher than that in WT. The downstream genes of LaHDZ31-34 
      were identified using Pearson correlation coefficients. Yeast one-hybrid and 
      dual-luciferase report assays revealed that the transcription factors LaHDZ31-34 
      could bind to the promoters of LaPAP, LaPP1, LaZFP5, and LaPHO1. This is the first 
      report of gene expression changes caused by LaMIR166a overexpression in Japanese 
      larch. These findings lay a foundation for future studies on the regulatory 
      mechanism of miR166.

TI  - Overexpression of Douglas-Fir LEAFY COTYLEDON1 (PmLEC1) in Arabidopsis Induces 
      Embryonic Programs and Embryo-like Structures in the lec1-1 Mutant but Not in Wild 
      Type Plants.

AB  - Somatic embryogenesis (SE) is the most promising method for the quick propagation of 
      desirable plant genotypes. However, application of SE to conifers remains 
      challenging due to our limited knowledge about the genes involved in embryogenesis 
      and the processes that lead to somatic embryo formation. Douglas-fir, an 
      economically important lumber species, possesses a homolog of the angiosperm 
      embryo-regulatory LEC1 gene. In the present study, we analyzed the potential of 
      Douglas-fir PmLEC1 to induce embryonic programs in the vegetative cells of a 
      heterologous host, Arabidopsis thaliana. PmLEC1 complemented the Arabidopsis lec1-1 
      null mutant and led to a variety of phenotypes ranging from normal morphology to 
      developmental arrest at various stages in the T1 generation. PmLEC1 did not affect 
      the morphology of wild type Arabidopsis T1 plants. More profound results occurred in 
      T2 generations. PmLEC1 expression induced formation of recurrent somatic embryo-like 
      structures in vegetative tissues of the rescued lec1-1 mutant but loss of apical 
      dominance (bushy phenotype) in wild type plants. The activation of embryonic 
      programs in the lec1-1(PmLEC1) T2 plants was confirmed by the presence of the 
      embryo-specific transcripts, OLEOSIN and CRUCIFERIN. In contrast, no embryo-like 
      structures, and no OLEOSIN or CRUCIFERIN were observed in PmLEC1-expressing bushy 
      wild type T2 plants.

AB  - Sessile plants encode a large number of small peptides and cell surface-resident 
      receptor kinases, most of which have unknown functions. Here, we report that the 
      Arabidopsis receptor kinase MALE DISCOVERER 1-INTERACTING RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE 2 
      (MIK2) recognizes the conserved signature motif of SERINE-RICH ENDOGENOUS PEPTIDEs 
      (SCOOPs) from Brassicaceae plants as well as proteins present in fungal Fusarium 
      spp. and bacterial Comamonadaceae, and elicits various immune responses. SCOOP 
      signature peptides trigger immune responses and altered root development in a 
      MIK2-dependent manner with a sub-nanomolar sensitivity. SCOOP12 directly binds to 
      the extracellular leucine-rich repeat domain of MIK2 in vivo and in vitro, 
      indicating that MIK2 is the receptor of SCOOP peptides. Perception of SCOOP peptides 
      induces the association of MIK2 and the coreceptors SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR 
      KINASE 3 (SERK3) and SERK4 and relays the signaling through the cytosolic 
      receptor-like kinases BOTRYTIS-INDUCED KINASE 1 (BIK1) and AVRPPHB SUSCEPTIBLE1 
      (PBS1)-LIKE 1 (PBL1). Our study identifies a plant receptor that bears a dual role 
      in sensing the conserved peptide motif from phytocytokines and microbial proteins 
      via a convergent signaling relay to ensure a robust immune response.

TI  - Tolerance of Douglas Fir Somatic Plantlets to Aluminum Stress: Biological, 
      Cytological, and Mineral Studies.
LID - 10.3390/plants9040536 [doi]
LID - 536
AB  - Aluminum (Al) is well known as a potent inhibitor of plant growth and development. 
      It is notably present in soils in the soluble and bioavailable form Al(3+) when the 
      soil pH drops below 5. This situation is frequent, especially in softwood forests 
      when litter decomposition is slow. In the present work, we studied the effects of 
      Al(3+) on the growth and development of Douglas fir plantlets. Somatic plantlets, 
      regenerated via somatic embryogenesis, were grown in vitro on media supplemented 
      with different concentrations of aluminum chloride (AlCl(3)): 0 µM, 200 µM, 500 µM. 
      and 1 mM. We show that a concentration of 500 µM AlCl3 in medium significantly 
      reduced root elongation (-21.8%), as well as stem growth (-14.6%). Also, a 25% 
      reduction in dry mass of the plantlets was observed in presence of a concentration 
      of 200 µM of AlCl3. Histological analysis of root tissues revealed significant 
      damage, especially in conducting vessels. In addition, mineral cation content of 
      plantlets was disturbed under Al exposure. More particularly, the Mg and K contents 
      of needles and the Ca content of stems and needles were significantly reduced in 
      presence of a concentration of 500 µM AlCl3 in the culture medium (-35.6%, -33.5%, 
      -24%, and -34% respectively). However, all these damages appeared at relatively high 
      Al concentrations when compared with other herbaceous species. This study shed light 
      on the ability of Douglas fir in vitro plantlets to cope with the acid-driven 
      toxicity of Al.

TI  - Dynamic Transcriptome Analysis Reveals Uncharacterized Complex Regulatory Pathway 
      Underlying Dose IBA-Induced Embryogenic Redifferentiation in Cotton.

AB  - The somatic embryogenesis (SE) process of plants is regulated by exogenous hormones. 
      During the SE, different genes sensitively respond to hormone signals through 
      complex regulatory networks to exhibit plant totipotency. When cultured in 
      indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) concentration gradient medium supplemented with 0 mg 
      dm(-3), 0.025 mg dm(-3), and 0.05 mg dm(-3) IBA, the callus differentiation rate 
      first increased then decreased in cotton. To characterize the molecular basis of 
      IBA-induced regulating SE, transcriptome analysis was conducted on embryogenic 
      redifferentiation. Upon the examination of the IBA's embryogenic inductive effect, 
      it was revealed that pathways related to plant hormone signal transduction and 
      alcohol degradation were significantly enriched in the embryogenic responsive stage 
      (5 days). The photosynthesis, alcohol metabolism and cell cycle pathways were 
      specifically regulated in the pre-embryonic initial period (20 days). Upon the 
      effect of the IBA dose, in the embryogenic responsive stage (5 days), the metabolism 
      of xenobiotics by the cytochrome P450 pathway and secondary metabolism pathways of 
      steroid, flavonoid, and anthocyanin biosynthesis were significantly enriched. The 
      phenylpropanoid, brassinosteroid, and anthocyanin biosynthesis pathways were 
      specifically associated in the pre-embryonic initial period (20 days). At different 
      developmental stages of embryogenic induction, photosynthesis, flavonoid 
      biosynthesis, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 
      signaling, xenobiotics metabolism by cytochrome P450, and brassinosteroid 
      biosynthesis pathways were enriched at low a IBA concentration. Meanwhile, at high 
      IBA concentration, the carbon metabolism, alcohol degradation, circadian rhythm and 
      biosynthesis of amino acids pathways were significantly enriched. The results reveal 
      that complex regulating pathways participate in the process of IBA-induced 
      redifferentiation in cotton somatic embryogenesis. In addition, collections of 
      potential essential signaling and regulatory genes responsible for dose IBA-induced 
      efficient embryogenic redifferentiation were identified. Quantitative real-time PCR 
      (qRT-PCR) was performed on the candidate genes with different expression patterns, 
      and the results are basically consistent with the RNA-seq data. The results suggest 
      that the complicated and concerted IBA-induced mechanisms involving multiple 
      cellular pathways are responsible for dose-dependent plant growth regulator-induced 
      SE. This report represents a systematic study and provides new insight into 
      molecular signaling and regulatory basis underlying the process of dose IBA-induced 
      embryogenic redifferentiation during SE.

TI  - Changes in abscisic acid metabolism in relation to the maturation of grapevine 
      (Vitis vinifera L., cv. Mencía) somatic embryos.
PG  - 487

LID - 487
AB  - BACKGROUND: Somatic embryogenesis in grapevines is a complex process that depends on 
      many physiological and genetic factors. One of its main limitations is the process 
      of precocious germination of the somatic embryos in differentiation medium. This 
      process lowers plant conversion rates from the somatic embryos, and it is probably 
      caused by a low endogenous abscisic acid (ABA) content. RESULTS: Precocious 
      germination of the somatic embryos was successfully avoided by culturing grapevine 
      cv. Mencía embryogenic aggregates over a semipermeable membrane extended on top of 
      the differentiation medium. The weekly analysis of the endogenous ABA and 
      ABA-glucosyl ester (ABA-GE) contents in the aggregates showed their rapid 
      accumulation. The expression profiles of 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase 
      (VvNCED1), 8'-hydroxylase (VvHyd2), UDP-glucosyltransferase (VvUGT) and 
      β-glucosidase (VvBG2) genes in grapevine revealed that the occurrence of a first 
      accumulation peak of endogenous ABA in the second week of culture over the 
      semipermeable membrane was mainly dependent on the expression of the VvNCED1 gene. A 
      second increase in the endogenous ABA content was observed in the fourth week of 
      culture. At this point in the culture, our results suggest that of those genes 
      involved in ABA accumulation, one (VvNCED1) was repressed, while another (VvBG2) was 
      activated. Similarly, of those genes related to a reduction in ABA levels, one 
      (VvUGT) was repressed while another (VvHyd2) was activated. The relative expression 
      level of the VvNCED1 gene in embryogenic aggregates cultured under the same 
      conditions and treated with exogenous ABA revealed the significant downregulation of 
      this gene. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated the involvement of ABA metabolism 
      in the control of the maturation of grapevine somatic embryos cultured over a 
      semipermeable membrane and two important control points for their endogenous ABA 
      levels. Thus, subtle differences in the expression of the antagonistic genes that 
      control ABA synthesis and degradation could be responsible for the final level of 
      ABA during the maturation of grapevine somatic embryos in vitro. In addition, the 
      treatment of somatic embryos with exogenous ABA suggested the feedback-based control 
      of the expression of the VvNCED1 gene by ABA during the maturation of grapevine 
      somatic embryos.

AB  - To date, there are few reports of the successful genetic transformation of larch and 
      other conifers, mainly because it is difficult to transform and integrate exogenous 
      genes. In this study, hybrid larch Larix kaempferi 3x Larix gmelinii 9 cones were 
      collected on June 27, July 1, July 4, July 7 and July 16, 2017. Embryogenic callus 
      induction was studied using a combination of different plant growth regulators and 
      concentrations. The results showed that July 1 was the best stage; the highest 
      induction rate was 10.83%, which cultured in BM medium (Button medium, which formula 
      was listed in S1 Table) with 1.0 mg/L 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) and 0.2 
      mg/L KT(kinetin). When cultured on a proliferation medium for 12 days, proliferation 
      was the fastest, reaching 323.08%, which could also maintain the freshness and 
      vitality. The suitable pre-culture medium for somatic embryogenesis was 1/4 BM 
      medium containing 10 g/L inositol and 60 g/L sucrose. The combination of 45 mg/L ABA 
      (abscisic acid) and 75 g/L PEG4000 (Polyethyene glycol 4000) could promote the 
      number of somatic embryos, and reached the maximum, 210 140 per 1 g FW. The genetic 
      transformation was carried out by the Agrobacterium-mediated transformation method 
      with embryogenic callus cultured for 12 days. The results showed the optimal OD600 
      of the infection solution(suspension of A. tumefaciens) was 0.5, co-culture time was 
      2 days, and screening concentration of Hyg (hygromycin B) was 4 mg/L. In this study, 
      the transformation rate of resistance callus was 32.1%. It provides a reference for 
      low genetic transformation efficiency of larch at present. This study could be 
      beneficial for the innovation and breeding of larch by genetic engineering and 
      provides a certain basis for rapid propagation of excellent larch germplasm 
      resources and genetic engineering breeding of larch and other conifers.

      element.

LID - 10.1111/tpj.14813 [doi]
AB  - Brachypodium distachyon is an annual C3 grass used as a monocot model system in 
      functional genomics research. Insertional mutagenesis is a powerful tool for both 
      forward and reverse genetics studies. In this study, we explored the possibility of 
      using the tobacco retrotransposon Tnt1 to create a transposon-based insertion mutant 
      population in B. distachyon. We developed transgenic B. distachyon plants expressing 
      Tnt1 (R0) and in the subsequent regenerants (R1) we observed that Tnt1 actively 
      transposed during somatic embryogenesis, generating an average of 6.37 insertions 
      per line in a population of 19 independent R1 regenerant plants analyzed. In 
      seed-derived progeny of R1 plants, Tnt1 segregated in a Mendelian ratio of 3:1 and 
      no new Tnt1 transposition was observed. A total of 126 flanking sequence tags (FSTs) 
      were recovered from the analyzed R0 and R1 lines. Analysis of the FSTs showed a 
      uniform pattern of insertion in all the chromosomes (1-5) without any preference for 
      a particular chromosome region. Considering the average length of a gene transcript 
      to be 3.37 kb, we estimated that 29 613 lines are required to achieve a 90% 
      possibility of tagging a given gene in the B. distachyon genome using the Tnt1-based 
      mutagenesis approach. Our results show the possibility of using Tnt1 to achieve 
      near-saturation mutagenesis in B. distachyon, which will aid in functional genomics 
      studies of other C3 grasses.

TI  - Marker-Assisted Selection for Pollen-Free Somatic Plants of Sugi (Japanese Cedar, 
      Cryptomeria japonica): A Simple and Effective Methodology for Selecting Male-Sterile

AB  - Pollen allergy caused by sugi (Japanese cedar, Cryptomeria japonica) is a serious 
      problem in Japan. One of the measures against pollinosis is the use of male-sterile 
      plants (MSPs; pollen-free plants). In this context, the development of a novel 
      technique for the efficient production of sugi MSPs, which combines marker-assisted 
      selection (MAS) with somatic embryogenesis (SE), was recently reported by our 
      research group. To improve the efficiency of MSP production, in this paper we report 
      improved MAS for male-sterile individuals from embryogenic cells, cotyledonary 
      embryos, and somatic plants of sugi using a newly developed marker in the form of 
      the causative mutation of MS1 itself, selecting individuals with ms1-1 and ms1-2 
      male-sterile mutations. We also describe simplified methods for extracting DNA from 
      different plant materials and for MAS using LAMP diagnostics. Finally, we show that 
      MAS can be efficiently performed using the one-step indel genotyping (ING) marker 
      developed in this study and using InstaGene for DNA extraction. The combination of 
      SE and 100% accurate marker selection during the embryogenic cell stage enables the 
      mass production of MS1 male-sterile sugi seedlings.

TI  - Characterization of phytohormone and transcriptome profiles during protocorm-like 
      bodies development of Paphiopedilum.
PG  - 806

LID - 806
AB  - BACKGROUND: Paphiopedilum, commonly known as slipper orchid, is an important genus 
      of orchid family with prominent horticultural value. Compared with conventional 
      methods such as tillers and in vitro shoots multiplication, induction and 
      regeneration of protocorm-like bodies (PLBs) is an effective micropropagation method 
      in Paphiopedilum. The PLB initiation efficiency varies among species, hybrids and 
      varieties, which leads to only a few Paphiopedilum species can be large-scale 
      propagated through PLBs. So far, little is known about the mechanisms behind the 
      initiation and maintenance of PLB in Paphiopedilum. RESULTS: A protocol to induce 
      PLB development from seed-derived protocorms of Paphiopedilum SCBG Huihuang90 (P. 
      SCBG Prince × P. SCBG Miracle) was established. The morphological characterization 
      of four key PLB developmental stages showed that significant polarity and cell size 
      gradients were observed within each PLB. The endogenous hormone level was evaluated. 
      The increase in the levels of indoleacetic acid (IAA) and jasmonic acid (JA) 
      accompanying the PLBs differentiation, suggesting auxin and JA levels were 
      correlated with PLB development. Gibberellic acid (GA) decreased to a very low 
      level, indicated that GA inactivation may be necessary for shoot apical meristem 
      (SAM) development. Comparative transcriptomic profiles of four different 
      developmental stages of P. SCBG Huihuang90 PLBs explore key genes involved in PLB 
      development. The numbers of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in three pairwise 
      comparisons (A vs B, B vs C, C vs D) were 1455, 349, and 3529, respectively. KEGG 
      enrichment analysis revealed that DEGs were implicated in secondary metabolite 
      metabolism and photosynthesis. DEGs related to hormone metabolism and signaling, 
      somatic embryogenesis, shoot development and photosynthesis were discussed in 
      detail. CONCLUSION: This study is the first report on PLB development in 
      Paphiopedilum using transcriptome sequencing, which provides useful information to 
      understand the mechanisms of PLB development.

TI  - Molecular characterization of miRNA genes and their expression in Dimocarpus longan 
      Lour.
PG  - 41
LID - 10.1007/s00425-021-03564-w [doi]
AB  - A genome-wide analysis of longan miRNA genes was conducted, and full-length 
      pri-miRNA transcripts were cloned. Bioinformatics and expression analyses 
      contributed to the functional characterization of longan miRNA genes. MicroRNAs are 
      important for the post-transcriptional regulation of target genes. However, little 
      is known about the transcription and regulation of miRNA genes in longan (Dimocarpus 
      longan Lour.). In this study, 80 miRNA precursors (pre-miRNA) were predicted, and 
      their secondary structure, size, conservation, and diversity were analyzed. 
      Furthermore, the full-length cDNA sequences of 13 longan primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) 
      were amplified by RLM-RACE and SMART-RACE and analyzed, which revealed that longan 
      pri-miRNA transcripts have multiple transcription start sites (TSSs) and the 
      downstream pre-miRNAs are polymorphic. Accordingly, the longan pri-miRNAs and 
      protein-encoding genes may have similar transcriptional specificities. An analysis 
      of the longan miRNA gene promoter elements indicated that the three most abundant 
      cis-acting elements were light-responsive, stress-responsive, and hormone-responsive 
      elements. A quantitative real-time PCR assay elucidated the potential spatial and 
      temporal expression patterns of longan pre-miRNAs during the early stages of somatic 
      embryogenesis (SE) and in different longan organs/tissues. This is the first report 
      regarding the molecular characterization of miRNA genes and their expression 
      profiles in longan. The generated data may serve as a foundation for future research 
      aimed at clarifying the longan miRNA gene functions.

LID - 25
AB  - BACKGROUND: Genotype independent transformation and whole plant regeneration through 
      somatic embryogenesis relies heavily on the intrinsic ability of a genotype to 
      regenerate. The critical genetic architecture of non-embryogenic callus (NEC) cells 
      and embryogenic callus (EC) cells in a highly regenerable cotton genotype is 
      unknown. RESULTS: In this study, gene expression profiles of a highly regenerable 
      Gossypium hirsutum L. cultivar, Jin668, were analyzed at two critical developmental 
      stages during somatic embryogenesis, non-embryogenic callus (NEC) cells and 
      embryogenic callus (EC) cells. The rate of EC formation in Jin668 is 96%. 
      Differential gene expression analysis revealed a total of 5333 differentially 
      expressed genes (DEG) with 2534 genes upregulated and 2799 genes downregulated in 
      EC. A total of 144 genes were unique to NEC cells and 174 genes were unique to EC. 
      Clustering and enrichment analysis identified genes upregulated in EC that function 
      as transcription factors/DNA binding, phytohormone response, oxidative reduction, 
      and regulators of transcription; while genes categorized in methylation pathways 
      were downregulated. Four key transcription factors were identified based on their 
      sharp upregulation in EC tissue; LEAFY COTYLEDON 1 (LEC1), BABY BOOM (BBM), FUSCA 
      (FUS3) and AGAMOUS-LIKE15 with distinguishable subgenome expression bias. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This comparative analysis of NEC and EC transcriptomes gives new 
      insights into the genes involved in somatic embryogenesis in cotton.

TI  - IDA (INFLORESCENCE DEFICIENT IN ABSCISSION)-like peptides and HAE (HAESA)-like 
      receptors regulate corolla abscission in Nicotiana benthamiana flowers.
PG  - 226
LID - 10.1186/s12870-021-02994-8 [doi]
LID - 226
AB  - BACKGROUND: Abscission is an active, organized, and highly coordinated cell 
      separation process enabling the detachment of aerial organs through the modification 
      of cell-to-cell adhesion and breakdown of cell walls at specific sites on the plant 
      body known as abscission zones. In Arabidopsis thaliana, abscission of floral organs 
      and cauline leaves is regulated by the interaction of the hormonal peptide 
      INFLORESCENCE DEFICIENT IN ABSCISSION (IDA), a pair of redundant receptor-like 
      protein kinases, HAESA (HAE) and HAESA-LIKE2 (HSL2), and SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS 
      RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE (SERK) co-receptors. However, the functionality of this 
      abscission signaling module has not yet been demonstrated in other plant species. 
      RESULTS: The expression of the pair of NbenIDA1 homeologs and the receptor NbenHAE.1 
      was supressed at the base of the corolla tube by the inoculation of two 
      virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) constructs in Nicotiana benthamiana. These gene 
      suppression events arrested corolla abscission but did not produce any obvious 
      effect on plant growth. VIGS plants retained a higher number of corollas attached to 
      the flowers than control plants, an observation related to a greater corolla 
      breakstrength. The arrest of corolla abscission was associated with the preservation 
      of the parenchyma tissue at the base of the corolla tube that, in contrast, was 
      virtually collapsed in normal corollas. In contrast, the inoculation of a viral 
      vector construct that increased the expression of NbenIDA1A at the base of the 
      corolla tube negatively affected the growth of the inoculated plants accelerating 
      the timing of both corolla senescence and abscission. However, the heterologous 
      ectopic overexpression of citrus CitIDA3 and Arabidopsis AtIDA in N. benthamiana did 
      not alter the standard plant phenotype suggesting that the proteolytic processing 
      machinery was unable to yield active peptides. CONCLUSION: Here, we demonstrate that 
      the pair of NbenIDA1 homeologs encoding small peptides of the IDA-like family and 
      the receptor NbenHAE.1 control cellular breakdown at the base of the corolla tube 
      awhere an adventitious AZ should be formed and, therefore, corolla abscission in N. 
      benthamiana flowers. Altogether, our results provide the first evidence supporting 
      the notion that the IDA-HAE/HSL2 signaling module is conserved in angiosperms.

TI  - AGL15 Controls the Embryogenic Reprogramming of Somatic Cells in Arabidopsis through 
      the Histone Acetylation-Mediated Repression of the miRNA Biogenesis Genes.

AB  - The embryogenic transition of somatic cells requires an extensive reprogramming of 
      the cell transcriptome. Relevantly, the extensive modulation of the genes that have 
      a regulatory function, in particular the genes encoding the transcription factors 
      (TFs) and miRNAs, have been indicated as controlling somatic embryogenesis (SE) that 
      is induced in vitro in the somatic cells of plants. Identifying the regulatory 
      relationships between the TFs and miRNAs during SE induction is of central 
      importance for understanding the complex regulatory interplay that fine-tunes a cell 
      transcriptome during the embryogenic transition. Hence, here, we analysed the 
      regulatory relationships between AGL15 (AGAMOUS-LIKE 15) TF and miR156 in an 
      embryogenic culture of Arabidopsis. Both AGL15 and miR156 control SE induction and 
      AGL15 has been reported to target the MIR156 genes in planta. The results showed 
      that AGL15 contributes to the regulation of miR156 in an embryogenic culture at two 
      levels that involve the activation of the MIR156 transcription and the containment 
      of the abundance of mature miR156 by repressing the miRNA biogenesis genes DCL1 
      (DICER-LIKE1), SERRATE and HEN1 (HUA-ENHANCER1). To repress the miRNA biogenesis 
      genes AGL15 seems to co-operate with the TOPLESS co-repressors (TPL and TPR1-4), 
      which are components of the SIN3/HDAC silencing complex. The impact of TSA 
      (trichostatin A), an inhibitor of the HDAC histone deacetylases, on the expression 
      of the miRNA biogenesis genes together with the ChIP results implies that histone 
      deacetylation is involved in the AGL15-mediated repression of miRNA processing. The 
      results indicate that HDAC6 and HDAC19 histone deacetylases might co-operate with 
      AGL15 in silencing the complex that controls the abundance of miR156 during 
      embryogenic induction. This study provides new evidence about the histone 
      acetylation-mediated control of the miRNA pathways during the embryogenic 
      reprogramming of plant somatic cells and the essential role of AGL15 in this 
      regulatory mechanism.

AB  - Picea mongolica, a native species with excellent industrial wood quality and strong 
      sand-fixing capacity, may be utilized in construction of urban green spaces in arid 
      areas in China. However, now the sustainability of the ecosystems where this species 
      grows is at serious risk due to a lack of natural regeneration. In this study, we 
      developed an efficient regeneration system and comprehensively analyzed various 
      factors affecting somatic embryogenesis (SE) using zygotic embryos as explants. We 
      identified the optimal plant growth regulators (PGRs) performance and the best donor 
      trees (k81) for the generation of somatic embryos (SEMs). Additionally, we confirmed 
      that the positive developmental window of SEMs initiation was at the end of July to 
      early August, which is when zygotic embryos was at the late embryogeny. In this time 
      period, specific transcripts associated with the regulation of epigenetic 
      modifications, plant hormone-related genes, and embryonic development-related 
      transcription factors play important roles for early SEMs initiation. These results 
      may provide a valuable resource for vegetative propagation of Picea mongolica. Our 
      results may help to establish a reliable protocol for plantlet regeneration, which 
      may facilitate urban greening applications and industrialization in arid areas.

AB  - The rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis Muell. Arg.) is a tropical tree species that 
      produce natural rubber. Self-rooted juvenile clones (SRJCs) are novel rubber tree 
      planting materials developed through primary somatic embryogenesis. SRJCs have a 
      higher rubber yield compared with donor clones (DCs). The molecular basis underlying 
      increased rubber yield in SRJCs remains largely unknown. Here, the latex from SRJCs 
      and DCs were collected for strand-specific and small RNA-seq methods. A total of 196 
      differentially expressed long noncoding RNAs (DELs), and 11 differentially expressed 
      microRNAs were identified in latex between SRJCs and DCs. Targeted genes of DELs 
      were markedly enriched for various biological pathways related to plant hormone 
      signal transduction, photosynthesis, glutathione metabolism, and amino acids 
      biosynthesis. DELs probably acted as cis-acting regulation was calculated, and these 
      DELs relevant to potentially regulate rubber biosynthesis, reactive oxygen species 
      metabolism, and epigenetic modification. Furthermore, the DELs acting as microRNA 
      targets were studied. The interaction of microRNA and DELs might involve in the 
      regulation of natural rubber biosynthesis.

AB  - ADP-ribosylation modification considered as a model to study histone 
      post-translational modification in chromatin modification. Despite it was reported 
      in many plants, the study of ARFs gene family in longan was still unclear. In this 
      study, 14 longan ARFs genes were identified using the longan genome (the 
      third-generation genome) and further divided into two major groups, including the 
      DlARF in the I-II group and the ARF-like (DlARL) in the III-V group, according to 
      their structure and evolutionary characteristics. Whole-genome duplication (WGD) and 
      segmental duplication events played a major role in the expansion of the DlARFs gene 
      family, the synteny and phylogenetic analyses provided a deeper insight into the 
      evolutionary characteristics of the DlARFs. Protein-protein interactions suggested 
      that some DlARFs proteins may interact to participate in biological processes. 
      Promoter analysis showed more stress response elements in DlARF5, DlGB1, DlARL1, 
      DlARL2, and DlARL8a, suggesting that they may participate in abiotic stress. 
      Expression profiles of DlARFs by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) showed that 
      they were abundant accumulation during early somatic embryogenesis (SE). Expression 
      pattern analysis of RNA-seq and qRT-PCR revealed that some ARFs members regulated 
      early SE, and respond to exogenous hormones and abiotic stress such as abscisic acid 
      (ABA), gibberellin A3 (GA3), salicylic acid (SA), methyl jasmonate (MeJA), cold, and 
      heat. Our study provides new insights for further research on the potential function 
      of DlARFs, which may be useful for the improvement of longan.

AB  - Somatic embryogenesis (SE) is the most important plant biotechnology process for 
      plant regeneration, propagation, genetic transformation and genome editing of 
      coffee, Coffea arabica L. Somatic embryo (SEs) conversion to plantlets is the 
      principal bottleneck for basic and applied use of this process. In this study we 
      focus on the maturation of SEs of C. arabica var. Typica. SEs conversion to plantlet 
      up to 95.9% was achieved under osmotic stress, using 9 g/L gelrite, as compared with 
      only 39.34% in non-osmotic stress. Mature SEs induced in osmotic stress developed 
      shoot and root apical meristems, while untreated SEs were unable to do it. C. 
      arabica regenerated plants from osmotic stress were robust, with higher leaf and 
      root area and internode length. To understand a possible regulatory mechanism, gene 
      expression of key genes of C. arabica, homologous to sequences in the Arabidopsis 
      thaliana genome, were analyzed. A set of two component system and cytokinin 
      signaling-related coding genes (AHK1, AHK3, AHP4 and ARR1) which interact with 
      WUSCHEL and WOX5 homedomains and morphogenic genes, BABY-BOOM, LEC1, FUS3 and AGL15, 
      underwent significant changes during maturation of SEs of C. arabica var. Typica. 
      This protocol is currently being applied in genetic transformation with high rate of 
      success.

TI  - Perception of the pathogen-induced peptide RGF7 by the receptor-like kinases RGI4 
      and RGI5 triggers innate immunity in Arabidopsis thaliana.
PG  - 1110-1125
LID - 10.1111/nph.17197 [doi]
AB  - Signaling peptides play crucial roles in plant growth, development and defense. We 
      report here that the Arabidopsis thaliana secreted peptide, ROOT MERISTEM GROWTH 
      FACTOR 7 (RGF7), functions as an endogenous elicitor to trigger plant immunity. 
      Expression of the RGF7 precursor-encoding gene (preRGF7) is highly induced in 
      Arabidopsis leaves upon infection by the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. 
      The pathogen-responsive preRGF7 expression is regulated by the transcription factor 
      WRKY33 and its upstream mitogen-activated protein kinases MPK3/MPK6 and 
      calcium-dependent protein kinases CPK5/CPK6. In the absence of pathogen attack, 
      chemically induced expression of preRGF7 in transgenic Arabidopsis plants was 
      sufficient to trigger immune responses. Pre-induction of preRGF7 expression in 
      transgenic Arabidopsis also led to enhanced immune responses and increased 
      resistance to P. syringae infection. Biochemical and genetic analyses demonstrated 
      that RGF7 is perceived by the leaf-expressed RGF1 INSENSITIVE (RGI) family receptors 
      RGI4 and RGI5. The SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR KINASES (SERKs) BAK1 and SERK4 are 
      also involved in RGF7 perception via forming RGF7-induced receptor-complexes with 
      RGI4 and RGI5. These results indicate that the pathogen-induced RGF7 peptide, 
      perceived by the RGI4/RGI5-BAK1/SERK4 receptor complexes, acts as a new 
      damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) and plays a significant role in 
      Arabidopsis immunity.

TI  - Polycomb Repressive Complex 2-mediated histone modification H3K27me3 is associated 
      with embryogenic potential in Norway spruce.
PG  - 6366-6378
LID - 10.1093/jxb/eraa365 [doi]
AB  - Epigenetic reprogramming during germ cell formation is essential to gain 
      pluripotency and thus embryogenic potential. The histone modification H3K27me3, 
      which is catalysed by the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), regulates important 
      developmental processes in both plants and animals, and defects in PRC2 components 
      cause pleiotropic developmental abnormalities. Nevertheless, the role of H3K27me3 in 
      determining embryogenic potential in gymnosperms is still elusive. To address this, 
      we generated H3K27me3 profiles of Norway spruce (Picea abies) embryonic callus and 
      non-embryogenic callus using CUT&RUN, which is a powerful method for chromatin 
      profiling. Here, we show that H3K27me3 mainly accumulated in genic regions in the 
      Norway spruce genome, similarly to what is observed in other plant species. 
      Interestingly, H3K27me3 levels in embryonic callus were much lower than those in the 
      other examined tissues, but markedly increased upon embryo induction. These results 
      show that H3K27me3 levels are associated with the embryogenic potential of a given 
      tissue, and that the early phase of somatic embryogenesis is accompanied by changes 
      in H3K27me3 levels. Thus, our study provides novel insights into the role of this 
      epigenetic mark in spruce embryogenesis and reinforces the importance of PRC2 as a 
      key regulator of cell fate determination across different plant species.

TI  - Agrobacterium rhizogenes-mediated transformation of grain (Amaranthus 
      hypochondriacus) and leafy (A. hybridus) amaranths.
PG  - 1143-1160
LID - 10.1007/s00299-020-02553-9 [doi]
AB  - Transgenic A. hypochondriacus and A. hybridus roots were generated. Further, a 
      distinct plant regeneration program via somatic embryos produced from hairy roots 
      was established. Work was implemented to develop an optimized protocol for root 
      genetic transformation of the three grain amaranth species and A. hybridus, their 
      presumed ancestor. Transformation efficiency was species-specific, being higher in 
      A. hypochondriacus and followed by A. hybridus. Amaranthus cruentus and A. caudatus 
      remained recalcitrant. A reliable and efficient Agrobacteruim rhizogenes-mediated 
      transformation of these species was established using cotyledon explants infected 
      with the previously untested BVG strain. Optimal OD(600) bacterial cell densities 
      were 0.4 and 0.8 for A. hypochondriacus and A. hybridus, respectively. Hairy roots 
      of both amaranth species were validated by the amplification of appropriate marker 
      genes and, when pertinent, by monitoring green fluorescent protein emission or 
      β-glucuronidase activity. Embryogenic calli were generated from A. hypochondriacus 
      rhizoclones. Subsequent somatic embryo maturation and germination required the 
      activation of cytokinin signaling, osmotic stress, red light, and calcium 
      incorporation. A crucial step to ensure the differentiation of germinating somatic 
      embryos into plantlets was their individualization and subcultivation in 5/5 media 
      containing 5% sucrose, 5 g/L gelrite, and 0.2 mg/L 2-isopentenyladenine (2iP) 
      previously acidified to pH 4.0 with phosphoric acid, followed by their transfer to 
      5/5 + 2iP media supplemented with 100 mg/L CaCl(2). These steps were strictly red 
      light dependent. This process represents a viable protocol for plant regeneration 
      via somatic embryo germination from grain amaranth transgenic hairy roots. Its 
      capacity to overcome the recalcitrance to genetic transformation characteristic of 
      grain amaranth has the potential to significantly advance the knowledge of several 
      unresolved biological aspects of grain amaranths.

TI  - Variation burst during dedifferentiation and increased CHH-type DNA methylation 
      after 30 years of in vitro culture of sweet orange.

AB  - Somaclonal variation arising from tissue culture may provide a valuable resource for 
      the selection of new germplasm, but may not preserve true-to-type characteristics, 
      which is a major concern for germplasm conservation or genome editing. The genomic 
      changes associated with dedifferentiation and somaclonal variation during long-term 
      in vitro culture are largely unknown. Sweet orange was one of the earliest plant 
      species to be cultured in vitro and induced via somatic embryogenesis. We compared 
      four sweet orange callus lines after 30 years of constant tissue culture with newly 
      induced calli by comprehensively determining the single-nucleotide polymorphisms, 
      copy number variations, transposable element insertions, methylomic and 
      transcriptomic changes. We identified a burst of variation during early 
      dedifferentiation, including a retrotransposon outbreak, followed by a variation 
      purge during long-term in vitro culture. Notably, CHH methylation showed a dynamic 
      pattern, initially disappearing during dedifferentiation and then more than 
      recovering after 30 years of in vitro culture. We also analyzed the effects of 
      somaclonal variation on transcriptional reprogramming, and indicated subgenome 
      dominance was evident in the tetraploid callus. We identified a retrotransposon 
      insertion and DNA modification alternations in the potential regeneration-related 
      gene CLAVATA3/EMBRYO SURROUNDING REGION-RELATED 16. This study provides the 
      foundation to harness in vitro variation and offers a deeper understanding of the 
      variation introduced by tissue culture during germplasm conservation, somatic 
      embryogenesis, gene editing, and breeding programs.

AB  - Araucaria angustifolia is classified as a critically endangered species by the 
      International Union for Conservation of Nature. This threat is worsened by the 
      inefficiency of methods for ex-situ conservation and propagation. In conifers, 
      somatic embryogenesis (SE) associated with cryopreservation is an efficient method 
      to achieve germplasm conservation and mass clonal propagation. However, the 
      efficiency of SE is highly dependent on genotype responsivity to the artificial 
      stimulus used in vitro during cell line proliferation and later during somatic 
      embryo development. In this study, we evaluated the activity of antioxidant enzymes 
      and characterized mitochondrial functions during the proliferation of embryogenic 
      cells of A. angustifolia responsive (SE1) and non-responsive (SE6) to the 
      development of somatic embryos. The activities of the antioxidant enzymes GR (EC 
      1.6.4.2), MDHAR (EC 1.6.5.4), and POX (EC 1.11.1.7) were increased in SE1 culture, 
      while in SE6 culture, only the activity of DHAR (EC 1.8.5.1) was significantly 
      higher. Additionally, SE6 culture presented a higher number of mitochondria, which 
      agreed with the increased rate of oxygen consumption compared to responsive SE1 
      culture; however, the mitochondrial volume was lower. Although the ATP levels did 
      not differ, the NAD(P)H levels were higher in SE1 cells. NDs, AOX, and UCP were less 
      active in responsive SE1 than in non-responsive cells. Our results show significant 
      differences between SE1 and SE6 embryogenic cells regarding mitochondrial functions 
      and antioxidant enzyme activities, which may be intrinsic to the in vitro 
      proliferation phase of both cell lines, possessing a crucial role for the induction 
      of in vitro maturation process.

TI  - Patterns of host cell inheritance in the bacterial symbiosis of whiteflies.
PG  - 938-946
LID - 10.1111/1744-7917.12708 [doi]
AB  - Whiteflies possess bacterial symbionts Candidatus Portiera aleyrodidium that are 
      housed in specialized cells called bacteriocytes and are faithfully transmitted via 
      the ovary to insect offspring. In one whitefly species studied previously, Bemisia 
      tabaci MEAM1, transmission is mediated by somatic inheritance of bacteriocytes, with 
      a single bacteriocyte transferred to each oocyte and persisting through 
      embryogenesis to the next generation. Here, we investigate the mode of bacteriocyte 
      transmission in two whitefly species, B. tabaci MED, the sister species of MEAM1, 
      and the phylogenetically distant species Trialeurodes vaporariorum. Microsatellite 
      analysis supported by microscopical studies demonstrates that B. tabaci MED 
      bacteriocytes are genetically different from other somatic cells and persist through 
      embryogenesis, as for MEAM1, but T. vaporariorum bacteriocytes are genetically 
      identical to other somatic cells of the insect, likely mediated by the degradation 
      of maternal bacteriocytes in the embryo. These two alternative modes of transmission 
      provide a first demonstration among insect symbioses that the cellular processes 
      underlying vertical transmission of bacterial symbionts can diversify among related 
      host species associated with a single lineage of symbiotic bacteria.

AB  - In a perspective entitled 'From plant survival under severe stress to anti-viral 
      human defense' we raised and justified the hypothesis that transcript level profiles 
      of justified target genes established from in vitro somatic embryogenesis (SE) 
      induction in plants as a reference compared to virus-induced profiles can identify 
      differential virus signatures that link to harmful reprogramming. A standard profile 
      of selected genes named 'ReprogVirus' was proposed for in vitro-scanning of early 
      virus-induced reprogramming in critical primary infected cells/tissues as target 
      trait. For data collection, the 'ReprogVirus platform' was initiated. This 
      initiative aims to identify in a common effort across scientific boundaries critical 
      virus footprints from diverse virus origins and variants as a basis for anti-viral 
      strategy design. This approach is open for validation and extension. In the present 
      study, we initiated validation by experimental transcriptome data available in 
      public domain combined with advancing plant wet lab research. We compared 
      plant-adapted transcriptomes according to 'RegroVirus' complemented by alternative 
      oxidase (AOX) genes during de novo programming under SE-inducing conditions with in 
      vitro corona virus-induced transcriptome profiles. This approach enabled identifying 
      a major complex trait for early de novo programming during SARS-CoV-2 infection, 
      called 'CoV-MAC-TED'. It consists of unbalanced ROS/RNS levels, which are connected 
      to increased aerobic fermentation that links to alpha-tubulin-based cell 
      restructuration and progression of cell cycle. We conclude that 
      anti-viral/anti-SARS-CoV-2 strategies need to rigorously target 'CoV-MAC-TED' in 
      primary infected nose and mouth cells through prophylactic and very early 
      therapeutic strategies. We also discuss potential strategies in the view of the 
      beneficial role of AOX for resilient behavior in plants. Furthermore, following the 
      general observation that ROS/RNS equilibration/redox homeostasis is of utmost 
      importance at the very beginning of viral infection, we highlight that 
      'de-stressing' disease and social handling should be seen as essential part of 
      anti-viral/anti-SARS-CoV-2 strategies.

AB  - In conifers, somatic embryogenesis is uniquely initiated from immature embryos in a 
      narrow time window, which is considerably hindered by the difficulty to induce 
      embryogenic tissue (ET) from other tissues, including mature somatic embryos. In 
      this study, the embryogenic ability of newly induced ET and DNA methylation levels 
      was detected, and whole-transcriptome sequencing analyses were carried out. The 
      results showed that ultra-low temperature treatment significantly enhanced ET 
      induction from mature somatic embryos, with the induction rate from 0.4% to 15.5%, 
      but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The newly induced ET showed higher 
      capability in generating mature embryos than the original ET. DNA methylation levels 
      fluctuated during the ET induction process. Here, WGCNA analysis revealed that OPT4, 
      TIP1-1, Chi I, GASA5, GST, LAX3, WRKY7, MYBS3, LRR-RLK, PBL7, and WIN1 genes are 
      involved in stress response and auxin signal transduction. Through co-expression 
      analysis, lncRNAs MSTRG.505746.1, MSTRG.1070680.1, and MSTRG.33602.1 might bind to 
      pre-novel_miR_339 to promote the expression of WRKY7 genes for stress response; LAX3 
      could be protected by lncRNAs MSTRG.1070680.1 and MSTRG.33602.1 via serving as 
      sponges for novel_miR_495 to initiate auxin signal transduction; lncRNAs 
      MSTRG.505746.1, MSTRG.1070680.1, and MSTRG.33602.1 might serve as sponges for 
      novel_miR_527 to enhance the expression of Chi I for early somatic embryo 
      development. This study provides new insight into the area of stress-enhanced early 
      somatic embryogenesis in conifers, which is also attributable to practical 
      applications.

AB  - Lamprocapnos spectabilis (L.) Fukuhara is a perennial plant species valued in the 
      horticultural, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical markets. To date, however, there were no 
      studies on tissue culture systems in this species when adjusted from 
      non-meristematic explants. The aim of this study is to induce callogenesis, 
      organogenesis, and somatic embryogenesis in non-meristematic explants of 
      Lamprocapnos spectabilis 'Alba' cultured in various media and to analyze the 
      chemical diversity of the produced callus. Leaf, petiole, and internode explants 
      were cultured on the modified Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium fortified with various 
      combinations and concentrations of 6-benzyladenine (BA), indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), 
      1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA), 2,4-dichlorphenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), and picloram 
      (PIC). After 10 weeks of culturing, the morphogenetic response of explants was 
      evaluated and the concentration of chlorophylls, carotenoids, anthocyanins, and 
      polyphenols in callus was analyzed. There was no influence of explant type on the 
      callogenesis efficiency (62.1-65.3%). The highest fresh weight of callus was 
      produced on leaf explants in the presence of 2,4-D or PIC. In contrast, the highest 
      share of dry weight was found in internode-derived calli and cultured on 
      IAA-supplemented medium (up to 30.8%). Only 2.5% of all explants regenerated 
      adventitious shoots, while rhizogenesis was reported in 4.5% of explants. Somatic 
      embryos were produced indirectly by 0% to 100% of explants, depending on the culture 
      medium and explant type. The highest mean number of embryos (11.4 per explant) was 
      found on petioles cultured in the MS medium with 0.5 mg·L(-1) BA and 1.0 mg·L(-1) 
      PIC. Calli cultured in media with NAA usually contained a higher content of primary 
      and secondary metabolites. There was also a significant impact of explant type on 
      the content of anthocyanins, polyphenols, and carotenoids in callus. Further studies 
      should focus on the elicitation of metabolites production in callus culture systems 
      of the bleeding heart.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Somatic variation is a valuable source of trait diversity in clonally 
      propagated crops. In grapevine, which has been clonally propagated worldwide for 
      centuries, important phenotypes such as white berry colour are the result of genetic 
      changes caused by transposable elements. Additionally, epiallele formation may play 
      a role in determining geo-specific ('terroir') differences in grapes and thus 
      ultimately in wine. This genomic plasticity might be co-opted for crop improvement 
      via somatic embryogenesis, but that depends on a species-specific understanding of 
      the epigenetic regulation of transposable element (TE) expression and silencing in 
      these cultures. For this reason, we used whole-genome bisulphite sequencing, mRNA 
      sequencing and small RNA sequencing to study the epigenetic status and expression of 
      TEs in embryogenic callus, in comparison with leaf tissue. RESULTS: We found that 
      compared with leaf tissue, grapevine embryogenic callus cultures accumulate 
      relatively high genome-wide CHH methylation, particularly across heterochromatic 
      regions. This de novo methylation is associated with an abundance of transcripts 
      from highly replicated TE families, as well as corresponding 24 nt heterochromatic 
      siRNAs. Methylation in the TE-specific CHG context was relatively low over TEs 
      located within genes, and the expression of TE loci within genes was highly 
      correlated with the expression of those genes. CONCLUSIONS: This multi-'omics 
      analysis of grapevine embryogenic callus in comparison with leaf tissues reveals a 
      high level of genome-wide transcription of TEs accompanied by RNA-dependent DNA 
      methylation of these sequences in trans. This provides insight into the genomic 
      conditions underlying somaclonal variation and epiallele formation in plants 
      regenerated from embryogenic cultures, which is an important consideration when 
      using these tissues for plant propagation and genetic improvement.

AB  - Stable transformation of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) has been successful, to 
      date, only using biolistic-mediated transformation and shoot regeneration from 
      meristem-containing embryo axes. In this study, using precultured embryo axes, and 
      optimal co-cultivation conditions resulted in a successful transformation of the 
      common bean cultivar Olathe using Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain EHA105. Plant 
      regeneration through somatic embryogenesis was attained through the preculture of 
      embryo axes for 12 weeks using induced competent cells for A. tumefaciens-mediated 
      gene delivery. Using A. tumefaciens at a low optical density (OD) of 0.1 at a 
      wavelength of 600 nm for infection and 4-day co-cultivation, compared to OD600 of 
      0.5, increased the survival rate of the inoculated explants from 23% to 45%. 
      Selection using 0.5 mg L-1 glufosinate (GS) was effective to identify transformed 
      cells when the bialaphos resistance (bar) gene under the constitutive 35S promoter 
      was used as a selectable marker. After an 18-week selection period, 1.5% -2.5% 
      inoculated explants, in three experiments with a total of 600 explants, produced 
      GS-resistant plants through somatic embryogenesis. The expression of bar was 
      confirmed in first- and second-generation seedlings of the two lines through reverse 
      polymerase chain reaction. Presence of the bar gene was verified through genome 
      sequencing of two selected transgenic lines. The induction of regenerable, competent 
      cells is key for the successful transformation, and the protocols described may be 
      useful for future transformation of additional Phaseolus germplasm.

      (AGs). AGPs are implicated in various plant growth and development processes 
      including cell expansion, somatic embryogenesis, root and stem growth, salt 
      tolerance, hormone signaling, male and female gametophyte development, and defense. 
      To date, eight Hyp-O-galactosyltransferases (GALT2-6, HPGT1-3) have been identified; 
      these enzymes are responsible for adding the first sugar, galactose, onto AGPs. Due 
      to gene redundancy among the GALTs, single or double galt genetic knockout mutants 
      are often not sufficient to fully reveal their biological functions. RESULTS: Here, 
      we report the successful application of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing/multiplexing 
      technology to generate higher-order knockout mutants of five members of the GALT 
      gene family (GALT2-6). AGPs analysis of higher-order galt mutants (galt2 galt5, 
      galt3 galt4 galt6, and galt2 galt3 galt4 galt5 gal6) demonstrated significantly less 
      glycosylated AGPs in rosette leaves, stems, and siliques compared to the 
      corresponding wild-type organs. Monosaccharide composition analysis of AGPs isolated 
      from rosette leaves revealed significant decreases in arabinose and galactose in all 
      the higher-order galt mutants. Phenotypic analyses revealed that mutation of two or 
      more GALT genes was able to overcome the growth inhibitory effect of β-D-Gal-Yariv 
      reagent, which specifically binds to β-1,3-galactan backbones on AGPs. In addition, 
      the galt2 galt3 galt4 galt5 gal6 mutant exhibited reduced overall growth, impaired 
      root growth, abnormal pollen, shorter siliques, and reduced seed set. Reciprocal 
      crossing experiments demonstrated that galt2 galt3 galt4 galt5 gal6 mutants had 
      defects in the female gametophyte which were responsible for reduced seed set. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing/multiplexing approach provides a simpler 
      and faster way to generate higher-order mutants for functional characterization 
      compared to conventional genetic crossing of T-DNA mutant lines. Higher-order galt 
      mutants produced and characterized in this study provide insight into the 
      relationship between sugar decorations and the various biological functions 
      attributed to AGPs in plants.

AB  - Intercellular signaling during embryo patterning is not well understood and the role 
      of symplasmic communication has been poorly considered. The correlation between the 
      symplasmic domains and the development of the embryo organs/tissues during zygotic 
      embryogenesis has only been described for a few examples, including Arabidopsis. How 
      this process occurs during the development of somatic embryos (SEs) is still 
      unknown. The aim of these studies was to answer the question: do SEs have a 
      restriction in symplasmic transport depending on the developmental stage that is 
      similar to their zygotic counterparts? The studies included an analysis of the GFP 
      distribution pattern as expressed under diverse promoters in zygotic embryos (ZEs) 
      and SEs. The results of the GFP distribution in the ZEs and SEs showed that 1/the 
      symplasmic domains between the embryo organs and tissues in the SEs was similar to 
      those in the ZEs and 2/the restriction in symplasmic transport in the SEs was 
      correlated with the developmental stage and was similar to the one in their zygotic 
      counterparts, however, with the spatio-temporal differences and different PDs SEL 
      value between these two types of embryos.

AB  - Larix olgensis or larch is an economically important coniferous tree species with 
      rapid growth in the early stages, strong adaptability, and a short time to harvest. 
      The genetic improvement of larch has garnered considerable attention in recent years 
      for reclaiming timber forests. However, traditional breeding methods are largely 
      ineffective for achieving rapid genetic improvement of L. olgensis. Studies show 
      that the efficiency of plant regeneration can be improved by optimizing somatic 
      embryogenesis. On this basis, we devised a stable, fast and efficient 
      Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation method using suspended embryogenic 
      calluses as explants and β-glucuronidase as the reporter. We evaluated the effects 
      of the Agrobacterium load, co-culture period, and addition of acetosyringone and 
      transformant screening antibiotic on the transformation efficiency. In addition, we 
      tested the pCAMBIA 1300-PtHCA 2-1 promoter-GUS binary expression vector, which 
      contains the GUS gene ORF under the control of Populus trichocarpa high cambial 
      activity PtHCA 2-1 promoter, and observed the tissue-specific expression of the GUS 
      gene in the somatic embryos of transgenic larch. This novel technique can not only 
      accelerate the generation of superior transgenic strains of L. olgensis but also aid 
      in future gene functional studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To meet increasing demand for forest-based products and protect natural 
      forests from further deforestation requires increased productivity from planted 
      forests. Genetic improvement of conifers by traditional breeding is time consuming 
      due to the long juvenile phase and genome complexity. Genetic modification (GM) 
      offers the opportunity to make transformational changes in shorter time frames but 
      is challenged by current genetically modified organism (GMO) regulations. Genome 
      editing, which can be used to generate site-specific mutations, offers the 
      opportunity to rapidly implement targeted improvements and is globally regulated in 
      a less restrictive way than GM technologies. RESULTS: We have demonstrated 
      CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in P. radiata targeting a single-copy cell wall gene GUX1 
      in somatic embryogenic tissue and produced plantlets from the edited tissue. We 
      generated biallelic INDELs with an efficiency of 15 % using a single gRNA. 12 % of 
      the transgenic embryogenic tissue was edited when two gRNAs were used and deletions 
      of up to 1.3 kb were identified. However, the regenerated plants did not contain 
      large deletions but had single nucleotide insertions at one of the target sites. We 
      assessed the use of CRISPR/Cas9 ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) for their ability to 
      accomplish DNA-free genome editing in P. radiata. We chose a hybrid approach, with 
      RNPs co-delivered with a plasmid-based selectable marker. A two-gRNA strategy was 
      used which produced an editing efficiency of 33 %, and generated INDELs, including 
      large deletions. Using the RNP approach, deletions found in embryogenic tissue were 
      also present in the plantlets. But, all plants produced using the RNP strategy were 
      monoallelic. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated the generation of biallelic and 
      monoallelic INDELs in the coniferous tree P. radiata with the CRISPR/Cas9 system 
      using plasmid expressed Cas9 gRNA and RNPs respectively. This opens the opportunity 
      to apply genome editing in conifers to rapidly modify key traits of interest.

AB  - Coffea spp. are tropical plants used for brewing beverages from roasted and grounded 
      seeds, the favorite drink in the world. It is the most important commercial crop 
      plant and the second most valuable international commodity after oil. Global coffee 
      trade relies on two Coffea species: C. arabica L. (arabica coffee) comprising 60% 
      and C. canephora (robusta) comprising the remaining 40%. Arabica coffee has lower 
      productivity and better market price than robusta. Arabica coffee is threatened by 
      disease (i.e., coffee leaf rust), pests [i.e., Hypothenemus hampei or coffee berry 
      borer (CBB) and nematodes], and susceptibility to climate change (i.e., drought and 
      aluminum toxicity). Plant biotechnology by means of tissue culture inducing somatic 
      embryogenesis (SE) process, genetic transformation, and genome editing are tools 
      that can help to solve, at least partially, these problems. This work is the 
      continuation of a protocol developed for stable genetic transformation and 
      successful plant regeneration of arabica coffee trees expressing the Bacillus 
      thuringiensis (Bt) toxin Cry10Aa to induce CBB resistance. A highly SE line with a 
      high rate of cell division and conversion to plants with 8-month plant regeneration 
      period was produced. To validate this capability, gene expression analysis of master 
      regulators of SE, such as BABY BOOM (BBM), FUS3, and LEC1, embryo development, such 
      as EMB2757, and cell cycle progression, such as ETG1 and MCM4, were analyzed during 
      induction and propagation of non-competent and highly competent embryogenic lines. 
      The particle bombardment technique was used to generate stable transgenic lines 
      after 3 months under selection using hygromycin as selectable marker, and 1 month in 
      plant regeneration. Transgenic trees developed fruits after 2 years and demonstrated 
      expression of the Bt toxin ranging from 3.25 to 13.88 μg/g fresh tissue. Bioassays 
      with transgenic fruits on CBB first instar larvae and adults induced mortalities 
      between 85 and 100% after 10 days. In addition, transgenic fruits showed a seed 
      damage lower than 9% compared to 100% of control fruits and adult mortality. This is 
      the first report on stable transformation and expression of the Cry10Aa protein in 
      coffee plants with the potential to control CBB.

TI  - Constitutive Activation of Leucine-Rich Repeat Receptor Kinase Signaling Pathways by 
      BAK1-INTERACTING RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE3 Chimera.
PG  - 3311-3323
LID - 10.1105/tpc.20.00138 [doi]
AB  - Receptor kinases with extracellular leucine-rich repeat domains (LRR-RKs) form the 
      largest group of membrane signaling proteins in plants. LRR-RKs can sense small 
      molecule, peptide, or protein ligands and may be activated by ligand-induced 
      interaction with a shape complementary SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE 
      (SERK) coreceptor kinase. We have previously shown that SERKs can also form 
      constitutive, ligand-independent complexes with the LRR ectodomains of 
      BAK1-INTERACTING RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE3 (BIR3) receptor pseudokinases, negative 
      regulators of LRR-RK signaling. Here, we report that receptor chimera in which the 
      extracellular LRR domain of BIR3 is fused to the cytoplasmic kinase domains of the 
      SERK-dependent LRR-RKs BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE1, HAESA and ERECTA form tight 
      complexes with endogenous SERK coreceptors in the absence of ligand stimulus. 
      Expression of these chimeras under the control of the endogenous promoter of the 
      respective LRR-RK leads to strong gain-of-function brassinosteroid, floral 
      abscission, and stomatal patterning phenotypes, respectively. Importantly, a 
      BIR3-GASSHO1 (GSO1)/SCHENGEN3 (SGN3) chimera can partially complement sgn3 Casparian 
      strip formation phenotypes, suggesting that SERK proteins also mediate GSO1/SGN3 
      receptor activation. Collectively, our protein engineering approach may be used to 
      elucidate the physiological functions of orphan LRR-RKs and to identify their 
      receptor activation mechanism in single transgenic lines.

AB  - Cryopreservation is one of the key technologies for the mass propagation of conifers 
      via somatic embryogenesis. Cryotolerance and embryogenecity of conifer somatic 
      embryos (SEs) could be affected by different temperature treatments, for which the 
      underlying mechanisms were unknown. In this study, the developing SEs of Picea 
      glauca obtained their cryotolerance with a survival rate of 100% when cultured on 
      maturation medium at either 23°C for 4 weeks or 4°C for 10 weeks. However, only the 
      embryos that underwent 4°C acclimation remained high embryogenicity, i.e., 91.7% 
      based on cryovials or 29.3% on the plant tissue. Analysis of differentially 
      expressed genes (DEGs) revealed that both 23 and 4°C treatments led to drastic 
      changes in the gene expression, i.e., 21,621 and 14,906 genes, respectively, and the 
      general increase in many oligosaccharides and flavonoids, in addition to the content 
      change of proline (1.9- and 2.3-fold at 23 or 4°C) and gallic acid (6,963- and 
      22,053-fold). There were 249 significantly different metabolites between the samples 
      of 23 and 4°C treatments and the changing trend of the sorbitol, fatty acids, and 
      monosaccharides differed between these samples. During 4°C-acclimation, the 
      metabolites of the arginine biosynthesis pathway increased between 2.4- and 
      8.1-fold, and the expression of antioxidant genes was up-regulated significantly. At 
      4°C, the up-regulated genes were for germ-like proteins, instead of seed storage 
      proteins at 23°C. Concentrations of abscisic acid and jasmonic acid increased up to 
      2- and 1.5-fold, respectively, in the cold-acclimated embryos. After 10 weeks at 
      4°C, the embryos stayed at pre-cotyledonary stage with 17.1% less DNA methylation 
      and fewer storage substances than those at 23°C for 4 weeks, which developed 
      cotyledons. This research provides new insights into mechanisms underlying the 
      response of SEs to different culture temperatures and benefits method development 
      for germplasm conservation in conifers.

AB  - Longan (Dimocarpus longan Lour.) is an important commercial fruit tree in southern 
      China. The embryogenesis of longan affects the quality and yield of fruit. A large 
      number of alternative splicing events occurs during somatic embryogenesis (SE), 
      which is regulated by serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins. However, the functions of 
      SR proteins in longan are poorly understood. In this study, 21 Dlo-SR gene family 
      members belonging to six subfamilies were identified, among which Dlo-RSZ20a, 
      Dlo-SR30, Dlo-SR17, Dlo-SR53 and Dlo-SR32 were localized in the nucleus, Dlo-RSZ20b, 
      Dlo-RSZ20c, Dlo-RSZ20d, Dlo-SC18, Dlo-RS2Z29, Dlo-SCL41, and Dlo-SR33 were localized 
      in chloroplasts, and Dlo-RS43, Dlo-SC33, Dlo-SC37, Dlo-RS2Z33, Dlo-RS2Z16, 
      Dlo-RS2Z24, Dlo-SCL43, Dlo-SR112, and Dlo-SR59 were localized in the nucleus and 
      chloroplasts. The Dlo-SR genes exhibited differential expression patterns in 
      different tissues of longan. The transcript levels of Dlo-RSZ20a, Dlo-SC18, 
      Dlo-RS2Z29, DLo-SR59, Dlo-SR53, and Dlo-SR17 were low in all analyzed tissues, 
      whereas Dlo-RS43, Dlo-RS2Z16, Dlo-RS2Z24, and Dlo-SR30 were highly expressed in all 
      tissues. To clarify their function during SE, the transcript levels of Dlo-SR genes 
      were analyzed at different four stages of SE, comprising non-embryonic callus (NEC), 
      friable-embryogenic callus (EC), incomplete compact pro-embryogenic culture (ICpEC) 
      and globular embryo (GE). Interestingly, the transcript levels of Dlo-RS2Z29 and 
      Dlo-SR112 were increased in embryogenic cells compared with the NEC stage, whereas 
      transcript levels of Dlo-RSZ20a, Dlo-RS43, Dlo-SC37, and Dlo-RS2Z16 were especially 
      increased at the GE stage compared with the other stages. Alternative splicing 
      events of Dlo-SR mRNA precursors (pre-mRNAs) was detected during SE, with totals of 
      41, 29, 35, and 44 events detected during NEC, EC, ICpEC, and GE respectively. 
      Protein-protein interaction analysis showed that SR proteins were capable of 
      interaction with each other. The results indicate that the alternative splicing of 
      Dlo-SR pre-mRNAs occurs during SE and that Dlo-SR proteins may interact to regulate 
      embryogenesis of longan.

AB  - AIM: This work aimed to study the somatic embryogenesis and organogenesis of 
      endangered Daucus pumilus (Gouan) for the conservation of this plant and improving 
      the production of secondary metabolites of medicinal value. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      The callus formation and in vitro propagation of D. pumilus (Gouan) by using a 
      different combination of naphthalene acetic acid and benzylaminopurine were 
      established. Various embryogenic stages were tracked using scanning electron 
      microscopy and light microscopy. The volatile constituents of the n-hexane extracts 
      of D. pumilus (Gouan) that extracted by ultrasonic-assisted technique were analyzed 
      by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Somatic 
      embryogenesis and organogenesis of endangered D. pumilus (Gouan) were established 
      for the first time. Myristicin and elemicin were successfully increased during 
      micropropagation to 70.89% and 2.19%, respectively. Furthermore, the induction of 
      compounds such as 6-methoxymellein, eugenin, methyl behenate, and 
      1,6-dimethylnaphthalene was also detected. CONCLUSION: Commercially, this protocol 
      decreases the dependence on wild medicinal plants, enhances the manufacturing of 
      valuable phytochemicals to meet the great demands of the pharmaceutical industries, 
      and acts as a mean for genetic transformation of this plant.

AB  - Haploids are plants with gametophytic chromosome number, which upon chromosome 
      duplication results in production of doubled haploids (DHs). There are several 
      methods to obtain haploids and DHs, of which in vitro anther culture is the most 
      effective and widely used method in tobacco. The production of haploids and DHs 
      through androgenesis allows for a single-step development of complete homozygous 
      lines from heterozygous genotypes, shortening the time required to produce 
      homozygous genotypes in comparison to the conventional breeding scheme. The DH 
      development process comprises two main steps: induction of androgenesis and 
      duplication of the haploid genome. The critical stages of DH protocol in tobacco are 
      determining the bud stage for anther culture, pretreatment, anther culture media, 
      detection and identification of haploids, and chromosome doubling. Here we present 
      an efficient anther culture protocol to get haploids and DHs in flue-cured virginia 
      (FCV) tobacco. This optimized protocol can be used as a potential tool for 
      generation of haploids and DHs for genetic improvement of tobacco.

TI  - Comparative proteomic analysis provides new insights into regulation of microspore

AB  - Effective microspore embryogenesis (ME) requires substantial modifications in gene 
      expression pattern, followed by changes in the cell proteome and its metabolism. 
      Recent studies have awakened also interest in the role of epigenetic factors in 
      microspore de-differentiation and reprogramming. Therefore, demethylating agent 
      (2.5-10 μM 5-azacytidine, AC) together with low temperature (3 weeks at 4 °C) were 
      used as ME-inducing tiller treatment in two doubled haploid (DH) lines of triticale 
      and its effect was analyzed in respect of anther protein profiles, expression of 
      selected genes (TAPETUM DETERMINANT1 (TaTPD1-like), SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR 
      KINASE 2 (SERK2) and GLUTATHIONE S-TRANSFERASE (GSTF2)) and ME efficiency. Tiller 
      treatment with 5.0 µM AC was the most effective in ME induction; it was associated 
      with (1) suppression of intensive anabolic processes-mainly photosynthesis and 
      light-dependent reactions, (2) transition to effective catabolism and mobilization 
      of carbohydrate reserve to meet the high energy demand of cells during microspore 
      reprograming and (3) effective defense against stress-inducing treatment, i.e. 
      protection of proper folding during protein biosynthesis and effective degradation 
      of dysfunctional or damaged proteins. Additionally, 5.0 µM AC enhanced the 
      expression of all genes previously identified as being associated with embryogenic 
      potential of microspores (TaTPD1-like, SERK and GSTF2).

AB  - An efficient anther culture on double-layered media to produce doubled haploid (DH) 
      plants in pepper (Capsicum annuum) was clearly shown to outperformed other 
      techniques such as anther culture on solid medium and direct isolated microspore 
      culture on liquid medium. It was even used for DH production in a cayenne type of 
      hot pepper which was previously known as less responsive or even more recalcitrant 
      to androgenesis than sweet bell pepper. Indeed, anther culture on double-layered 
      media has been routinely used to produce DH plants on broad genotypes of C. annuum 
      as parental candidates to develop hybrid varieties. The step-by-step protocol of 
      pepper anther culture on double-layered media, we hereby present in detail, includes 
      the growth of donor plants, the use of flower buds as anther source, flower bud 
      disinfection, anther isolation, anther culture and incubation processes, embryo 
      germination and plant acclimatization process, and transplanting of plants to the 
      soil-compost medium in pots.

TI  - Leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase II phylogenetics reveals five main clades 
      throughout the plant kingdom.
PG  - 547-560
LID - 10.1111/tpj.14749 [doi]
AB  - Receptor-like kinases (RLKs) represent the largest group of cell surface receptors 
      in plants. The monophyletic leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-RLK subfamily II is considered 
      to contain the somatic embryogenesis receptor kinases (SERKs) and NSP-interacting 
      kinases known to be involved in developmental processes and cellular immunity in 
      plants. There are only a few published studies on the phylogenetics of LRR-RLKII; 
      unfortunately these suffer from poor taxon/gene sampling. Hence, it is not clear how 
      many and what main clades this family contains, let alone what structure-function 
      relationships exist. We used 1342 protein sequences annotated as 'SERK' and 
      'SERK-like' plus related sequences in order to estimate phylogeny within the 
      LRR-RLKII clade, using the nematode protein kinase Pelle as an outgroup. We 
      reconstruct five main clades (LRR-RLKII 1-5), in each of which the main pattern of 
      land plant relationships re-occurs, confirming previous hypotheses that duplication 
      events happened in this gene subfamily prior to divergence among land plant 
      lineages. We show that domain structures and intron-exon boundaries within the five 
      clades are well conserved in evolution. Furthermore, phylogenetic patterns based on 
      the separate LRR and kinase parts of LRR-RLKs are incongruent: whereas the LRR part 
      supports a LRR-RLKII 2/3 sister group relationship, the kinase part supports clades 
      1/2. We infer that the kinase part includes few 'radical' amino acid changes 
      compared with the LRR part. Finally, our results confirm that amino acids involved 
      in each LRR-RLKII-receptor complex interaction are located at N-capping residues, 
      and that the short amino acid motifs of this interaction domain are highly conserved 
      throughout evolution within the five LRR-RLKII clades.

TI  - Spontaneous Regeneration of Plantlets Derived from Hairy Root Cultures of Lopezia 
      racemosa and the Cytotoxic Activity of Their Organic Extracts.
LID - 10.3390/plants11020150 [doi]
LID - 150
AB  - A histological analysis was performed with the aim of elucidating the spontaneous 
      regeneration process of the hairy root lines LRT 2.3 and LRT 6.4, derived from 
      Lopezia racemosa leaf explants and genetically transformed with the 
      Agrobacterium&nbsp;rhizogenes strain ATCC15834/pTDT. The analysis showed both lines 
      regenerate via indirect somatic embryogenesis; LRT 6.4 also regenerated by direct 
      organogenesis. The morphogenic characteristics of the regenerated plantlets from 
      both lines showed the typical characteristics, described previously, including a 
      higher number of axillary shoot formation, short internodes, and plagiotropic roots 
      compared with wild-type seedlings. The regeneration process occurred without the 
      addition of plant growth regulators and was linked to the sucrose concentration in 
      the culture medium. Reducing the sucrose concentration from 3% to 2%, 1%, and 0.5% 
      increased the regeneration rate in LRT 6.4; the effect was less pronounced in LRT 
      2.3. The cytotoxic activity of different organic extracts obtained from roots and 
      shoots were evaluated in the cancer cell lines HeLa (cervical carcinoma), HCT-15 
      (colon adenocarcinoma), and OVCAR (ovary carcinoma). The hexane and dichloromethane 
      extracts from roots of both lines showed cytotoxic activity against the HeLa cell 
      line. Only the dichloromethane extract from the roots of PLRT 2.3 showed cytotoxic 
      activity against the OVCAR cell line. None of the methanol extracts showed cytotoxic 
      activity, nor the shoot extracts from any solvent.

AB  - The present study provides a visual insight into the effects of simulated 
      microgravity (MG) on somatic embryogenesis (SE) in Begonia through the analysis of 
      phytohormone fluctuations and energy metabolism. To investigate this relationship, 
      thin cell layer culture model was first used. The results showed that MG changed the 
      phytohormone content and stimulated starch biosynthesis to convert into sugar to 
      release energy needed for regeneration and proliferation. Moreover, from the results 
      it is likely that MG accelerated the initiation and subsequently maturation and 
      aging of SE via decrease of AUX and increase of ABA. High content of GA, CKs, 
      starch, sugar and low ABA as well as high CKs/ABA ratio were responsible for the 
      increase in the number of embryos under clinorotation which was 1.57-fold higher 
      than control after 90 days. The increase in fresh and dry weight of somatic embryos 
      and chlorophyll content under MG were confirmed as their adaptive responses to 
      gravitational stress. However, long-term exposure to MG (120 days) stimulated 
      biosynthesis of ABA levels 1.85-fold higher than controls, which resulted in a 
      decrease in chlorophyll content, increase in number of mature embryos and stomata 
      length. These results revealed that MG regulated the induction, differentiation and 
      senescence of somatic embryos via a biochemical interaction pathway.

AB  - Arbuscular Mycorrhizal fungi (AMF, Glomeromycota) form obligate symbiotic 
      associations with the roots of most terrestrial plants. Our understanding of the 
      molecular mechanisms enabling AMF propagation and AMF-host interaction is currently 
      incomplete. Analysis of AMF proteomes could yield important insights and generate 
      hypotheses on the nature and mechanism of AMF-plant symbiosis. Here, we examined the 
      extraradical mycelium proteomic profile of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus 
      Rhizophagus irregularis grown on Ri T-DNA transformed Chicory roots in a root organ 
      culture setting. Our analysis detected 529 different peptides that mapped to 474 
      translated proteins in the R. irregularis genome. R. irregularis proteome was 
      characterized by a high proportion of proteins (9.9 % of total, 21.4 % of proteins 
      with functional prediction) mediating a wide range of signal transduction processes, 
      e.g. Rho1 and Bmh2, Ca-signaling (calmodulin, and Ca channel protein), mTOR 
      signaling (MAP3K7, and MAPKAP1), and phosphatidate signaling (phospholipase D1/2) 
      proteins, as well as members of the Ras signaling pathway. In addition, the proteome 
      contained an unusually large proportion (53.6 %) of hypothetical proteins, the 
      majority of which (85.8 %) were Glomeromycota-specific. Forty-eight proteins were 
      predicted to be surface/membrane associated, including multiple hypothetical 
      proteins of yet-unrecognized functions. However, no evidence for the overproduction 
      of specific proteins, previously implicated in promoting soil health and aggregation 
      was obtained. Finally, the comparison of R. irregularis proteome to previously 
      published AMF proteomes identified a core set of pathways and processes involved in 
      AMF growth. We conclude that R. irregularis growth on chicory roots requires the 
      activation of a wide range of signal transduction pathways, the secretion of 
      multiple novel hitherto unrecognized Glomeromycota-specific proteins, and the 
      expression of a wide array of surface-membrane associated proteins for cross kingdom 
      cell-to-cell communications.

AB  - Grapevine may be affected simultaneously by several pathogens whose complex 
      interplay is largely unknown. We studied the effects of infection by two grapevine 
      viruses on powdery mildew and downy mildew development and the molecular 
      modifications induced in grapevines by their multiple interactions. Grapevine 
      fanleaf virus (GFLV) and grapevine rupestris stem pitting-associated virus (GRSPaV) 
      were transmitted by in vitro-grafting to Vitis vinifera cv Nebbiolo and Chardonnay 
      virus-free plantlets regenerated by somatic embryogenesis. Grapevines were then 
      artificially inoculated in the greenhouse with either Plasmopara viticola or 
      Erysiphe necator spores. GFLV-infected plants showed a reduction in severity of the 
      diseases caused by powdery and downy mildews in comparison to virus-free plants. 
      GFLV induced the overexpression of stilbene synthase genes, pathogenesis-related 
      proteins, and influenced the genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism in grapevine. 
      These transcriptional changes suggest improved innate plant immunity, which makes 
      the GFLV-infected grapevines less susceptible to other biotic attacks. This, 
      however, cannot be extrapolated to GRSPaV as it was unable to promote protection 
      against the fungal/oomycete pathogens. In these multiple interactions, the grapevine 
      genotype seemed to have a crucial role: in 'Nebbiolo', the virus-induced molecular 
      changes were different from those observed in 'Chardonnay', suggesting that 
      different metabolic pathways may be involved in protection against fungal/oomycete 
      pathogens. These results indicate that complex interactions do exist between 
      grapevine and its different pathogens and represent the first study on a topic that 
      still is largely unexplored.

TI  - RNA-Seq with a novel glabrous-ZM24fl reveals some key lncRNAs and the associated 
      targets in fiber initiation of cotton.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cotton fiber is an important natural resource for textile industry and 
      an excellent model for cell biology study. Application of glabrous mutant cotton and 
      high-throughput sequencing facilitates the identification of key genes and pathways 
      for fiber development and cell differentiation and elongation. LncRNA is a type of 
      ncRNA with more than 200 nt in length and functions in the ways of chromatin 
      modification, transcriptional and post-transcriptional modification, and so on. 
      However, the detailed lncRNA and associated mechanisms for fiber initiation are 
      still unclear in cotton. RESULTS: In this study, we used a novel glabrous mutant 
      ZM24fl, which is endowed with higher somatic embryogenesis, and functions as an 
      ideal receptor for cotton genetic transformation. Combined with the high-throughput 
      sequencing, fatty acid pathway and some transcription factors such as MYB, ERF and 
      bHLH families were identified the important roles in fiber initiation; furthermore, 
      3,288 lncRNAs were identified, and some differentially expressed lncRNAs were also 
      analyzed. From the comparisons of ZM24_0 DPA vs ZM24_-2 DPA and fl_0 DPA vs ZM24_0 
      DPA, one common lncRNA MSTRG 2723.1 was found that function upstream of fatty acid 
      metabolism, MBY25-mediating pathway, and pectin metabolism to regulate fiber 
      initiation. In addition, other lncRNAs MSTRG 3390.1, MSTRG 48719.1, and MSTRG 
      31176.1 were also showed potential important roles in fiber development; and the 
      co-expression analysis between lncRNAs and targets showed the distinct models of 
      different lncRNAs and complicated interaction between lncRNAs in fiber development 
      of cotton. CONCLUSIONS: From the above results, a key lncRNA MSTRG 2723.1 was 
      identified that might mediate some key genes transcription of fatty acid metabolism, 
      MYB25-mediating pathway, and pectin metabolism to regulate fiber initiation of ZM24 
      cultivar. Co-expression analysis implied that some other important lncRNAs (e.g., 
      MSTRG 3390.1, MSTRG 48719.1, and MSTRG 31176.1) were also showed the different 
      regulatory model and interaction between them, which proposes some valuable clues 
      for the lncRNAs associated mechanisms in fiber development.

AB  - Polyploidy is more than two chromosomal sets per nucleus, as the allotetraploid 
      Coffea arabica. Due to allotetraploidy, C. arabica shows different phenotypes 
      compare to diploid Coffea species, highlighting by beverage quality produced from 
      its grains. Looking for the possibility of new phenotypes coupled with economic 
      feature, considerable progress since 60's was reached for synthetic chromosome set 
      doubling (CSD) in vitro, involving especially the antitubulin compounds, biological 
      material, and used tissue culture pathway as the indirect somatic embryogenesis 
      (ISE). Here, we aimed to regenerate autotetraploid and auto-alloctaploid plantlets 
      of Coffea canephora and C. arabica, respectively, from a novel in vitro CSD 
      procedure for Coffea. Exploring the ISE pathway, we treated the cellular aggregate 
      suspensions (CAS) with 0.0 (control), 0.5, 1.5, or 2.5 mM of colchicine solution for 
      48, 72, or 96 h and maintained in liquid medium under constant orbital shaking. 
      After transferring the CAS to semisolid media for somatic embryo regeneration, we 
      considered it as cellular mass. Mature cotyledonary somatic embryos were only 
      regenerated from cellular masses treated with 2.5 mM/48 h and 2.5 mM/72 h for C. 
      canephora and with 0.5 mM/48 h for C. arabica. Evaluating the DNA ploidy level and 
      the chromosome counting revealed that 36 (34.9%) plantlets of C. canephora were 
      autotetraploids (4C = 2.86 pg, 2n = 4x = 44) and 61 (21.1%) of C. arabica were 
      auto-alloctaploids (4C = 5.24 pg, 2n = 8x = 88). The CSD procedure, exploring the 
      CAS proliferation and ISE pathway, promoted whole-genome duplication and resulted in 
      a relatively high number of solid polyploids of both Coffea species. Due to distinct 
      responses, DNA sequence fidelity (genetic) and global level of 5-methylcytosine 
      (epigenetic) were evaluated. We observed that the increase of 5-methylcytosine 
      levels was associated with somatic embryo regeneration from cells showing DNA 
      sequence fidelity for the tested SSR primers. In conclusion, the adopted procedure 
      for in vitro CSD is reproducible for induction, regeneration and propagation of 
      Coffea polyploids and potentially other shrubbery and woody species. In view of the 
      novelty of this procedure to generate new germplasm, we show the key issues and the 
      steps of the CSD procedure.

AB  - Somatic embryogenesis receptor kinases (SERKs) play a significant role in 
      morphogenesis, stress/defense and signal transduction. In the present study, we have 
      identified two SERK and 11 SERK-like (SERL) genes in Phalaenopsis equestris, two 
      SERK and 11 SERL genes in Dendrobium catenatum, and one SERK and eight SERL genes in 
      Apostasia shenzhenica genome. Characterization of the SERK proteins revealed the 
      presence of a signal peptide, a leucine zipper, five leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), a 
      serine proline proline (SPP) motif, a transmembrane region, a kinase domain, and a 
      C-terminus. Most of the SERK/SERL proteins were characterized with similar 
      physicochemical properties. The presence of transmembrane region predicted their 
      membranous localization. Tertiary structure prediction of all the five identified 
      SERK proteins had sequence identity with BAK1 protein of Arabidopsis thaliana. 
      Generally, all the SERK/SERL genes shared similar gene architecture and intron 
      phasing. Gene ontology analysis indicated the role of SERKs in receptor and ATP 
      binding, signal transduction, and protein phosphorylation. Phylogenetic analysis 
      revealed the clustering of SERKs and SERLs in distinct clades. Expression of SERKs 
      in reproductive tissues like floral bud, floral stalk, whole flower and pollen was 
      reported to be higher than their expression in vegetative tissues with an exception 
      of PeSERK1 and DcSERK1 which showed higher expression in leaves and roots, 
      respectively. Likewise, a higher expression of AsSERK1 was observed in tubers. 
      However, lower expression of SERLs was observed in majority of tissues studied 
      irrespective of their vegetative or reproductive origin. This work paves way for 
      future studies involving functional characterization of SERK/SERLs and their 
      potential role in embryogenesis/organogenesis as an aid to regeneration and 
      multiplication of endangered orchids.

TI  - SHR4z, a novel decoy effector from the haustorium of the parasitic weed Striga 
      gesnerioides, suppresses host plant immunity.
PG  - 891-908
LID - 10.1111/nph.16351 [doi]
AB  - Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) cultivar B301 is resistant to races SG4 and SG3 of the 
      root parasitic weed Striga gesnerioides, developing a hypersensitive response (HR) 
      at the site of parasite attachment. By contrast, race SG4z overcomes B301 resistance 
      and successfully parasitises the plant. Comparative transcriptomics and in silico 
      analysis identified a small secreted effector protein dubbed Suppressor of Host 
      Resistance 4z (SHR4z) in the SG4z haustorium that upon transfer to the host roots 
      causes a loss of host immunity (i.e. decreased HR and increased parasite growth). 
      SHR4z has significant homology to the short leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain of 
      SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE (SERK) family proteins and functions by 
      binding to VuPOB1, a host BTB-BACK domain-containing ubiquitin E3 ligase homologue, 
      leading to its rapid turnover. VuPOB1 is shown to be a positive regulator of HR 
      since silencing of VuPOB1 expression in transgenic B301 roots lowers the frequency 
      of HR and increases the levels of successful SG4 parasitism and overexpression 
      decreases parasitism by SG4z. These findings provide new insights into how parasitic 
      weeds overcome host defences and could potentially contribute to the development of 
      novel strategies for controlling Striga and other parasitic weeds thereby enhancing 
      crop productivity and food security globally.

TI  - YUCCA-Mediated Biosynthesis of the Auxin IAA Is Required during the Somatic 
      Embryogenic Induction Process in Coffea canephora.
LID - 10.3390/ijms21134751 [doi]
LID - 4751
AB  - Despite the existence of considerable research on somatic embryogenesis (SE), the 
      molecular mechanism that regulates the biosynthesis of auxins during the SE 
      induction process remains unknown. Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is an auxin that is 
      synthesized in plants through five pathways. The biosynthetic pathway most 
      frequently used in this synthesis is the conversion of tryptophan to indol-3-pyruvic 
      acid (IPA) by tryptophan aminotransferase of Arabidopsis (TAA) followed by the 
      conversion of IPA to IAA by enzymes encoded by YUCCA (YUC) genes of the flavin 
      monooxygenase family; however, it is unclear whether YUC-mediated IAA biosynthesis 
      is involved in SE induction. In this study, we report that the increase of IAA 
      observed during SE pre-treatment (plants in MS medium supplemented with 
      1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) 0.54 µM and kinetin (Kin) 2.32 µM for 14 days) was 
      due to its de novo biosynthesis. By qRT-PCR, we demonstrated that YUC gene 
      expression was consistent with the free IAA signal found in the explants during the 
      induction of SE. In addition, the use of yucasin to inhibit the activity of YUC 
      enzymes reduced the signal of free IAA in the leaf explants and dramatically 
      decreased the induction of SE. The exogenous addition of IAA restored the SE process 
      in explants treated with yucasin. Our findings suggest that the biosynthesis and 
      localization of IAA play an essential role during the induction process of SE in 
      Coffea canephora.

TI  - Profiles of endogenous ABA, bioactive GAs, IAA and their metabolites in Medicago

      relation to somatic embryo formation.

AB  - During the 3-week-long induction phase, when M. truncatula cells leaf explants from 
      non-embryogenic genotype (M9) and embryogenic variant (M9-10a) were forming the 
      callus, biosynthesis and degradation of ABA, Gas and IAA proceeded at different 
      levels. Induction of embryo formation is related to a lower ABA content, compared to 
      the content of IAA and that of total bioactive GAs. Endogenous phytohormones are 
      involved in the regulation of zygotic embryogenesis, but their role, especially of 
      ABA, a plant growth inhibitor, in inducing somatic embryogenesis (SE) in angiosperms 
      is still incompletely known. To arrive a better understanding of the ABA role in the 
      process, we analyzed simultaneously and in detail changes in the contents of both 
      ABA and five bioactive GAs (GA(4,) GA(7,) GA(1), GA(3,) GA(6)) and IAA in M. 
      truncatula non-embryogenic M9 (NE) and embryogenic M9-10a (E) genotypes. The initial 
      leaf explants of both genotypes, and particularly NE, contained many times more ABA 
      compared to the total bioactive GAs or IAA. In tissues during the entire 21-day 
      induction all the hormones mentioned and their metabolites or conjugates were 
      present; however, their contents were found to differ between the lines tested. The 
      ABA level in primary explants of NE genotype was more than two times higher than 
      that in E genotype. An even larger difference in the ABA content was found on the 
      last day (day 21) of the induction phase (IP); the ABA content in E callus was over 
      six times lower than in NE callus. In contrast, the IAA and GAs contents in primary 
      explants of both genotypes in relation to ABA were low, but the contents of IAA and 
      GAs exceeded that of ABA in the M9-10a tissues on the last day of IP. It is shown 
      for the first time that endogenous ABA together with endogenous bioactive GAs and 
      IAA is involved in acquisition of embryogenic competence in Medicago truncatula leaf 
      somatic cells. These findings have a strong functional implication as they allow to 
      improve the SE induction protocol.

TI  - Global Transcriptomic Analysis Reveals Differentially Expressed Genes Involved in 
      Embryogenic Callus Induction in Drumstick (Moringa oleifera Lam.).
LID - 10.3390/ijms222212130 [doi]
LID - 12130
AB  - The plant embryogenic callus (EC) is an irregular embryogenic cell mass with strong 
      regenerative ability that can be used for propagation and genetic transformation. 
      However, difficulties with EC induction have hindered the breeding of drumstick, a 
      tree with diverse potential commercial uses. In this study, three drumstick EC cDNA 
      libraries were sequenced using an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 system. A total of 7191 
      differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for embryogenic callus development were 
      identified, of which 2325 were mapped to the KEGG database, with the categories of 
      plant hormone signal transduction and Plant-pathogen interaction being 
      well-represented. The results obtained suggest that auxin and cytokinin metabolism 
      and several embryogenesis-labeled genes are involved in embryogenic callus 
      induction. Additionally, 589 transcription factors from 20 different families were 
      differentially expressed during EC formation. The differential expression of 16 
      unigenes related to auxin signaling pathways was validated experimentally by 
      quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) using samples representing three sequential 
      developmental stages of drumstick EC, supporting their apparent involvement in 
      drumstick EC formation. Our study provides valuable information about the molecular 
      mechanism of EC formation and has revealed new genes involved in this process.

TI  - Efficient Transformation of Somatic Embryos and Regeneration of Cork Oak Plantlets 
      with A Gene (CsTL1) Encoding a Chestnut Thaumatin-Like Protein.
LID - 10.3390/ijms22041757 [doi]
LID - 1757
AB  - We present a reproducible procedure for transforming somatic embryos of cork oak 
      with the CsTL1 gene that codes for a thaumatin-like protein, in order to confer 
      tolerance to Phytophthora cinnamomi. Different concentrations/combinations of the 
      antibiotics carbenicillin and cefotaxime, as bacteriostatic agents, and kanamycin, 
      as a selective agent, were tested. A lethal dose of 125 mg/L kanamycin was employed 
      to select transgenic somatic embryos, and carbenicillin was used as a bacteriostatic 
      agent at a concentration of 300 mg/L, which does not inhibit somatic embryo 
      proliferation. The transformation efficiency was clearly genotype-dependent and was 
      higher for the TGR3 genotype (17%) than for ALM80 (4.5%) and ALM6 (2%). Insertion of 
      the transgenes in genomic DNA was confirmed by PCR analysis, whereas expression of 
      the CsTL1 gene was evaluated by semi-quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis. A 
      vitrification treatment successfully cryopreserved the transgenic lines generated. 
      The antifungal activity of the thaumatin-like protein expressed by the gene CsTL1 
      was evaluated in an in vitro bioassay with the oomycete P. cinnamomi. Of the eight 
      transgenic lines analyzed, seven survived for between one or two times longer than 
      non-transgenic plantlets. Expression of the CsTL1 gene and plantlet survival days 
      were correlated, and survival was generally greater in plantlets that strongly 
      expressed the CsTL1 gene.

TI  - Heterochromatin formation in Drosophila requires genome-wide histone deacetylation 
      in cleavage chromatin before mid-blastula transition in early embryogenesis.
PG  - 83-98
LID - 10.1007/s00412-020-00732-x [doi]
AB  - Su(var) mutations define epigenetic factors controlling heterochromatin formation 
      and gene silencing in Drosophila. Here, we identify SU(VAR)2-1 as a novel chromatin 
      regulator that directs global histone deacetylation during the transition of 
      cleavage chromatin into somatic blastoderm chromatin in early embryogenesis. 
      SU(VAR)2-1 is heterochromatin-associated in blastoderm nuclei but not in later 
      stages of development. In larval polytene chromosomes, SU(VAR)2-1 is a band-specific 
      protein. SU(VAR)2-1 directs global histone deacetylation by recruiting the histone 
      deacetylase RPD3. In Su(var)2-1 mutants H3K9, H3K27, H4K8 and H4K16 acetylation 
      shows elevated levels genome-wide and heterochromatin displays aberrant histone 
      hyper-acetylation. Whereas H3K9me2- and HP1a-binding appears unaltered, the 
      heterochromatin-specific H3K9me2S10ph composite mark is impaired in heterochromatic 
      chromocenters of larval salivary polytene chromosomes. SU(VAR)2-1 contains an 
      NRF1/EWG domain and a C2HC zinc-finger motif. Our study identifies SU(VAR)2-1 as a 
      dosage-dependent, heterochromatin-initiating SU(VAR) factor, where the 
      SU(VAR)2-1-mediated control of genome-wide histone deacetylation after cleavage and 
      before mid-blastula transition (pre-MBT) is required to enable heterochromatin 
      formation.

AB  - Banana and plantain are among the foremost staple food crops providing food and 
      livelihood to over 500 million people in tropical countries. Despite the importance, 
      their production is hampered due to several biotic and abiotic stresses. Plant 
      tissue culture techniques such as somatic embryogenesis and genetic transformation 
      offer a valuable tool for genetic improvement. Identification and quantification of 
      phytochemicals found in banana and plantain are essential in optimizing in vitro 
      activities for crop improvement. Total antioxidants, phenolics, flavonoids, and 
      tannins were quantified in various explants obtained from the field, as well as in 
      vitro plants of banana and plantain cultivars. The result showed genotypic variation 
      in the phytochemicals of selected cultivars. The embryogenic cell suspensions were 
      developed for three farmer-preferred plantain cultivars, Agbagba, Obino l'Ewai, and 
      Orishele, using different MS and B5-based culture media. Both culture media 
      supported the development of friable embryogenic calli (FEC), while MS culture media 
      supported the proliferation of fine cell suspension in liquid culture media. The 
      percentage of FEC generated for Agbagba, Obino l'Ewai, and Orishele were 22 ± 24%, 
      13 ± 28%, and 9 ± 16%, respectively. Cell suspensions produced from FECs were 
      successfully transformed by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation with reporter gene 
      constructs and regenerated into whole plants.

AB  - In vitro tissue culture could be exploited to study cellular mechanisms that induce 
      sequence variation. Altering the metal ion composition of tissue culture medium 
      affects biochemical pathways involved in tissue culture-induced variation. Copper 
      ions are involved in the mitochondrial respiratory chain and Yang cycle. Copper ions 
      may participate in oxidative mutations, which may contribute to DNA sequence 
      variation. Silver ions compete with copper ions to bind to the complex IV subunit of 
      the respiratory chain, thus affecting the Yang cycle and DNA methylation. The 
      mechanisms underlying somaclonal variation are unknown. In this study, we evaluated 
      embryo-derived barley regenerants obtained from a single double-haploid plant via 
      embryo culture under varying copper and silver ion concentrations and different 
      durations of in vitro culture. Morphological variation among regenerants and the 
      donor plant was not evaluated. Methylation-sensitive Amplified Fragment Length 
      Polymorphism analysis of DNA samples showed DNA methylation pattern variation in CG 
      and CHG (H = A, C, or T) sequence contexts. Furthermore, modification of in vitro 
      culture conditions explained DNA sequence variation, demethylation, and de novo 
      methylation in the CHG context, as indicated by analysis of variance. Linear 
      regression indicated that DNA sequence variation was related to de novo DNA 
      methylation in the CHG context. Mediation analysis showed the role of copper ions as 
      a mediator of sequence variation in the CHG context. No other contexts showed a 
      significant sequence variation in mediation analysis. Silver ions did not act as a 
      mediator between any methylation contexts and sequence variation. Thus, 
      incorporating copper ions in the induction medium should be treated with caution.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Eucalyptus is a highly diverse genus of the Myrtaceae family and widely 
      planted in the world for timber and pulp production. Tissue culture induced callus 
      has become a common tool for Eucalyptus breeding, however, our knowledge about the 
      genes related to the callus maturation and shoot regeneration is still poor. 
      RESULTS: We set up an experiment to monitor the callus induction and callus 
      development of two Eucalyptus species - E. camaldulensis (high embryogenic 
      potential) and E. grandis x urophylla (low embryogenic potential). Then, we 
      performed transcriptome sequencing for primary callus, mature callus, shoot 
      regeneration stage callus and senescence callus. We identified 707 upregulated and 
      694 downregulated genes during the maturation process of the two Eucalyptus species 
      and most of them were involved in the signaling pathways like plant hormone and 
      MAPK. Next, we identified 135 and 142 genes that might play important roles during 
      the callus development of E. camaldulensis and E. grandis x urophylla, respectively. 
      Further, we found 15 DEGs shared by these two Eucalyptus species during the callus 
      development, including Eucgr.D00640 (stem-specific protein TSJT1), Eucgr.B00171 
      (BTB/POZ and TAZ domain-containing protein 1), Eucgr.C00948 (zinc finger CCCH 
      domain-containing protein 20), Eucgr.K01667 (stomatal closure-related actinbinding 
      protein 3), Eucgr.C00663 (glutaredoxin-C10) and Eucgr.C00419 (UPF0481 protein 
      At3g47200). Interestingly, the expression patterns of these genes displayed "N" 
      shape in the samples. Further, we found 51 genes that were dysregulated during the 
      callus development of E. camaldulensis but without changes in E. grandis x 
      urophylla, such as Eucgr.B02127 (GRF1-interacting factor 1), Eucgr.C00947 
      (transcription factor MYB36), Eucgr.B02752 (laccase-7), Eucgr.B03985 (transcription 
      factor MYB108), Eucgr.D00536 (GDSL esterase/lipase At5g45920) and Eucgr.B02347 
      (scarecrow-like protein 34). These 51 genes might be associated with the high 
      propagation ability of Eucalyptus and 22 might be induced after the 
      dedifferentiation. Last, we performed WGCNA to identify the co-expressed genes 
      during the callus development of Eucalyptus and qRT-PCR experiment to validate the 
      gene expression patterns. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first time to globally study the 
      gene profiles during the callus development of Eucalyptus. The results will improve 
      our understanding of gene regulation and molecular mechanisms in the callus 
      maturation and shoot regeneration.

TI  - The Rice Xa3 Gene Confers Resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae in the Model 
      Rice Kitaake Genetic Background.
PG  - 49

LID - 49
AB  - The rice XA21 and XA3 pattern receptor kinases, derived from Oryza longistaminata 
      and an Oryza. sativa japonica cultivar Wase Aikoku 3, respectively, confer 
      resistance to strains of the Gram-negative bacterium Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae 
      (Xoo), the causal agent of rice bacterial blight disease. Previously, we showed that 
      transfer of Xa21 to the model rice cultivar Kitaake enhances resistance to Xoo. In 
      this manuscript we demonstrate that Kitaake expressing Xa3 confers resistance to Xoo 
      strain PXO79 and that the stress-related marker genes PR10b and KO5 are upregulated 
      in Xoo-infected Xa3 rice leaves. We also show that rice somatic embryogenesis 
      receptor kinase 2 (OsSERK2) positively regulates XA3-mediated immunity in Kitaake. 
      We found that overexpression of XA21 binding protein 15 (XB15) and XB24, two 
      negative regulators of XA21-mediated immunity, do not affect XA3-mediated immunity 
      in the Kitaake genetic background. Our results indicate that the rice immune 
      receptors XA21 and XA3 employ both shared and distinct signaling components in their 
      response to Xoo. The results are important to further understand pathogen-associated 
      molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity in rice. Furthermore, the presence of 
      Kitaake rice carrying Xa3 will facilitate genetic research to study the XA3-mediated 
      immunity.

TI  - Essential roles of SERKs in the ROOT MERISTEM GROWTH FACTOR-mediated signaling 
      pathway.
LID - kiac036 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/plphys/kiac036 [doi]
AB  - RGFs, a group of peptide hormones, play key roles in root apical meristem 
      development. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), there are 11 members of ROOT 
      MERISTEM GROWTH FACTORs (RGFs), in which at least RGF1, RGF2 and RGF3 are expressed 
      at the root tip and are involved in root stem cell niche maintenance. RGFs are 
      perceived by 5 functionally redundant receptor-like protein kinases, RGF1 
      INSENSITIVE 1 (RGI1) to RGI5, to maintain the expression of two downstream APETALA 2 
      (AP2) transcription factor genes, PLETHORA 1 (PLT1) and PLT2, and to stabilize PLT2. 
      RGI1 to RGI3 were also named RGF RECEPTOR 1 (RGFR1) to RGFR3, respectively. Although 
      previous studies have suggested that BRI1-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR KINASE 1 (BAK1) and 
      its paralogs, SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASEs (SERKs), may act as 
      coreceptors of RGIs, comprehensive genetic and biochemical analyses have not been 
      well documented. Here, we report that single, double, and triple mutants of SERKs 
      show various degrees of short root phenotypes and insensitivity to exogenously 
      applied RGF1. The interaction between RGIs and BAK1 and their mutual phosphorylation 
      are RGF1 dependent. We also found that RGF1-induced MAPK activation relies on both 
      RGIs and SERKs. We demonstrate that RGIs play redundant roles in regulating root 
      apical meristem development. Therefore, we genetically and biochemically 
      substantiated that SERKs, as coreceptors, play essential roles in the RGF1-mediated 
      signaling pathway.

TI  - Genome-wide identification, molecular evolution, and expression analysis provide new 
      insights into the APETALA2/ethylene responsive factor (AP2/ERF) superfamily in 
      Dimocarpus longan Lour.
PG  - 62

AB  - BACKGROUND: The APETALA2/ethylene responsive factor (AP2/ERF) superfamily members 
      are transcription factors that regulate diverse developmental processes and stress 
      responses in plants. They have been identified in many plants. However, little is 
      known about the AP2/ERF superfamily in longan (Dimocarpus longan Lour.), which is an 
      important tropical/subtropical evergreen fruit tree that produces a variety of 
      bioactive compounds with rich nutritional and medicinal value. We conducted a 
      genome-wide analysis of the AP2/ERF superfamily and its roles in somatic 
      embryogenesis (SE) and developmental processes in longan. RESULTS: A genome-wide 
      survey of the AP2/ERF superfamily was carried out to discover its evolution and 
      function in longan. We identified 125 longan AP2/ERF genes and classified them into 
      the ERF (101 members), AP2 (19 members), RAV (four members) families, and one 
      Soloist. The AP2 and Soloist genes contained one to ten introns, whereas 87 genes in 
      the ERF and RAV families had no introns. Hormone signaling molecules such as methyl 
      jasmonate (MeJA), abscisic acid (ABA), gibberellin, auxin, and salicylic acid (SA), 
      and stress response cis-acting element low-temperature (55) and defense (49) boxes 
      also were identified. We detected diverse single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 
      between the 'Hong He Zi' (HHZ) and 'SI JI MI' (SJM) cultivars. The number of 
      insertions and deletions (InDels) was far fewer than SNPs. The AP2 family members 
      exhibited more alternative splicing (AS) events in different developmental processes 
      of longan than members of the other families. Expression pattern analysis revealed 
      that some AP2/ERF members regulated early SE and developmental processes in longan 
      seed, root, and flower, and responded to exogenous hormones such as MeJA, SA, and 
      ABA, and 2,4-D, a synthetic auxin. Protein interaction predictions indicated that 
      the Baby Boom (BBM) transcription factor, which was up-regulated at the 
      transcriptional level in early SE, may interact with the LALF/AGL15 network. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The comprehensive analysis of molecular evolution and expression 
      patterns suggested that the AP2/ERF superfamily may plays an important role in 
      longan, especially in early SE, and in seed, root, flower, and young fruit. This 
      systematic analysis provides a foundation for further functional characterization of 
      the AP2/ERF superfamily with the aim of longan improvement.

AB  - In this study, a label-free quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis was performed to 
      identify and quantify signaling events related to the acquisition of embryogenic 
      competence in sugarcane. Embryogenic and nonembryogenic calli were compared at the 
      multiplication phase, resulting in the identification of 163 phosphoproteins unique 
      to embryogenic calli, 9 unique to nonembryogenic calli, and 51 upregulated and 40 
      downregulated in embryogenic calli compared to nonembryogenic calli. Data are 
      available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD018054. Motif-x analysis revealed 
      the enrichment of [xxxpSPxxx], [RxxpSxxx], and [xxxpSDxxx] motifs, which are 
      predicted phosphorylation sites for several kinases related to stress responses. The 
      embryogenic-related phosphoproteins (those unique and upregulated in embryogenic 
      calli) identified in the present study are related to abscisic acid-induced 
      signaling and abiotic stress response; they include OSK3, ABF1, LEAs, and RD29Bs. On 
      the other hand, the nonembryogenic-related phosphoproteins EDR1 and PP2Ac-2 are 
      negative regulators of abscisic acid signaling, suggesting a relationship between 
      phosphoproteins involved in the abscisic acid and stress responses in the 
      acquisition of embryogenic competence. Moreover, embryogenic-related phosphoproteins 
      associated with epigenetic modifications, such as HDA6, HDA19, and TOPLESS, and with 
      RNA metabolism, including AGO1, DEAH5, SCL30, UB2C, and SR45, were identified to 
      play potential roles in embryogenic competence. These results reveal novel 
      phosphorylation sites for several proteins and identify potential candidate 
      biomarkers for the acquisition of embryogenic competence in sugarcane.

TI  - Comparative transcriptome analysis of gynoecious and monoecious inflorescences 
      reveals regulators involved in male flower development in the woody perennial plant 
      Jatropha curcas.

AB  - ABCE model genes along with genes related to GA biosynthesis and auxin signalling 
      may play significant roles in male flower development in Jatropha curcas. Flowering 
      plants exhibit extreme reproductive diversity. Jatropha curcas, a woody plant that 
      is promising for biofuel production, is monoecious. Here, two gynoecious Jatropha 
      mutants (bearing only female flowers) were used to identify key genes involved in 
      male flower development. Using comparative transcriptome analysis, we identified 17 
      differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in floral organ development between 
      monoecious plants and the two gynoecious mutants. Among these DEGs, five floral 
      organ identity genes, Jatropha AGAMOUS, PISTILLATA, SEPALLATA 2-1 (JcSEP2-1), 
      JcSEP2-2, and JcSEP3, were downregulated in ch mutant inflorescences; two 
      gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis genes, Jatropha GA REQUIRING 1 and GIBBERELLIN 
      3-OXIDASE 1, were downregulated in both the ch and g mutants; and two genes involved 
      in the auxin signalling pathway, Jatropha NGATHA1 and STYLISH1, were downregulated 
      in the ch mutant. Furthermore, four hub genes involved in male flower development, 
      namely Jatropha SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE 1, CRYPTOCHROME 2, 
      SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CO 1 and JAGGED, were identified using weighted gene 
      correlation network analysis. These results suggest that floral organ identity genes 
      and genes involved in GA biosynthesis and auxin signalling may participate in male 
      flower development in Jatropha. This study will contribute to understanding sex 
      differentiation in woody perennial plants.

TI  - Transmission of Engineered Plastids in Sugarcane, a C(4) Monocotyledonous Plant, 
      Reveals that Sorting of Preprogrammed Progenitor Cells Produce Heteroplasmy.

AB  - We report here plastid transformation in sugarcane using biolistic transformation 
      and embryogenesis-based regeneration approaches. Somatic embryos were developed from 
      unfurled leaf sections, containing preprogrammed progenitor cells, to recover 
      transformation events on antibiotic-containing regeneration medium. After developing 
      a proficient regeneration system, the FLARE-S (fluorescent antibiotic resistance 
      enzyme, spectinomycin and streptomycin) expression cassette that carries 
      species-specific homologous sequence tails was used to transform plastids and track 
      gene transmission and expression in sugarcane. Plants regenerated from 
      streptomycin-resistant and genetically confirmed shoots were subjected to visual 
      detection of the fluorescent enzyme using a fluorescent stereomicroscope, after 
      genetic confirmation. The resultant heteroplasmic shoots remained to segregate on 
      streptomycin-containing MS medium, referring to the unique pattern of division and 
      sorting of cells in C(4) monocotyledonous compared to C(3) monocotyledonous and 
      dicotyledonous plants since in sugarcane bundle sheath and mesophyll, cells are 
      distinct and sort independently after division. Hence, the transformation of either 
      mesophyll or bundle sheath cells will develop heteroplasmic transgenic plants, 
      suggesting the transformation of both types of cells. Whilst developed transgenic 
      sugarcane plants are heteroplasmic, and selection-based regeneration protocol 
      envisaging the role of division and sorting of cells in the purification of 
      transplastomic demands further improvement, the study has established many 
      parameters that may open up exciting possibilities to express genes of agricultural 
      or pharmaceutical importance in sugarcane.

AB  - In vitro recalcitrance of wheat to regeneration is the major bottleneck for its 
      improvement through callus-based genetic transformation. Nanotechnology is one of 
      the most dynamic areas of research, which can transform agriculture and 
      biotechnology to ensure food security on sustainable basis. Present study was 
      designed to investigate effects of CuSO(4), AgNO(3) and their nanoparticles on 
      tissue culture responses of mature embryo culture of wheat genotypes (AS-2002 and 
      Wafaq-2001). Initially, MS-based callus induction and regeneration medium were 
      optimized for both genotypes using various concentrations of auxin (2,4-D, IAA) and 
      cytokinins (BAP, kinetin). The genotypes differed for embryogenic callus induction 
      and regeneration potential. Genotype AS-2002 yielded maximum embryogenic calli in 
      response to 3.0 mg/l 2,4-D, whereas Wafaq-2001 offered the highest embryogenic calli 
      against 3.5 mg/l 2,4-D supplemented in the induction medium. Genotype AS-2002 showed 
      maximum regeneration (59.33%) in response to regeneration protocol comprising 0.5 
      mg/l IAA, 0.3 mg/l BAP and 1.0 mg/l Kin, while Wafaq-2001 performed best in response 
      to 0.5 mg/l IAA, 0.3 mg/l BAP and 1.5 mg/l Kin with 55.33% regeneration efficiency. 
      The same optimized basal induction and regeneration medium for both genotypes were 
      further used to study effects of CuSO(4), AgNO(3) and their nano-particles employing 
      independent experiments. The optimized induction medium fortified with various 
      concentrations of CuSO(4) or CuNPs confirmed significant effects on frequency of 
      embryogenic callus. Addition of either 0.020 mg/l or 0.025 mg/l CuSO(4), or 0.015 
      mg/l CNPs showed comparable results for embryogenic callus induction and were 
      statistically at par with embryogenic callus induction of 74.00%, 75.67% and 76.83%, 
      respectively. Significantly higher regeneration was achieved from MS-based 
      regeneration medium supplemented with 0.015 mg/l or 0.020 mg/l CuNPs than standard 
      0.025 mg/l CuSO(4). In another study, the basal induction and regeneration medium 
      were fortified with AgNO(3) or AgNPs ranging from 1 to 7 mg/l along with basal 
      regeneration media devoid of AgNO(3) or AgNPs (control). The maximum embryogenic 
      calli were witnessed from medium fortified with 3.0 mg/l or 4.0 mg/l AgNPs compared 
      with control and rest of the treatments. The standardized regeneration medium 
      fortified with 5.0 mg/l AgNO(3) or 3.0 mg/l AgNPs showed pronounced effect on 
      regeneration of wheat genotypes and offered maximum regeneration compared with 
      control. The individual and combined effect of Cu and Ag nanoparticles along with 
      control (basal regeneration media of each genotype) was also tested. Surprisingly, 
      co-application of metallic NPs showed a significant increase in embryogenic callus 
      formation of genotypes. Induction medium supplemented with 0.015 mg/l CuNPs + 4.0 
      mg/l AgNPs or 0.020 mg/l CuNPs + 2.0 mg/l AgNPs showed splendid results compared to 
      control and other combination of Cu and Ag nanoparticles. The maximum regeneration 
      was achieved by co-application of 0.015 mg/l CuNP and 4.0 mg/l AgNPs with 21% 
      increment of regeneration over control. It is revealed that CuNPs and AgNPs are 
      potential candidate to augment somatic embryogenesis and regeneration of mature 
      embryo explants of wheat.Abbreviations: 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid), BAP

      Medicago truncatula demonstrated a significant role of this gene in somatic embryo 
      formation. In this study, EgENOD93 was overexpressed in the important model plant 
      Arabidopsis thaliana to investigate the embryogenic potential of EgENOD93 transgenic 
      Arabidopsis explants compared to explants from control plants (pMDC140 and WT). 
      Experiments using leaf explants revealed higher numbers of regenerated shoots at day 
      27 in all the homozygous transgenic Arabidopsis cultures (Tg01, Tg02 and Tg03) 
      compared to controls. The expression level of EgENOD93 in Arabidopsis cultures was 
      quantified using reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). The 
      results supported the overexpression of this gene in transgenic Arabidopsis 
      cultures, with 6 and 10 times higher expression of EgENOD93 in callus at Day 9 and 
      Day 20, respectively. Overall, the results support the role of EgENOD93 in the 
      enhancement of shoot regeneration in transgenic Arabidopsis. This together with the 
      previous results observed in oil palm and Medicago truncatula suggests that ENOD93 
      plays a key role in the induction of somatic embryogenesis. A similarity to early 
      nodulation-like ontogeny is possible.

TI  - Repression of Carotenoid Accumulation by Nitrogen and NH(4)(+) Supply in Carrot 
      Callus Cells In Vitro.
LID - 10.3390/plants10091813 [doi]
LID - 1813
AB  - The effect of mineral nutrition on the accumulation of the main health beneficial 
      compounds in carrots, the carotenoid pigments, remains ambiguous; here, a 
      model-based approach was applied to reveal which compounds are responsible for the 
      variation in carotenoid content in carrot cells in vitro. For this purpose, 
      carotenoid-rich callus was cultured on either BI (modified Gamborg B5) or R 
      (modified Murashige and Skoog MS) mineral media or on modified media obtained by 
      exchanging compounds between BI and R. Callus growing on the BI medium had abundant 
      carotene crystals in the cells and a dark orange color in contrast to pale orange 
      callus with sparse crystals on the R medium. The carotenoid content, determined by 
      HPLC and spectrophotometrically after two months of culture, was 5.3 higher on the 
      BI medium. The replacement of media components revealed that only the N 
      concentration and the NO(3):NH(4) ratio affected carotenoid accumulation. Either the 
      increase of N amount above 27 mM or decrease of NO(3):NH(4) ratio below 12 resulted 
      in the repression of carotenoid accumulation. An adverse effect of the increased 
      NH(4)(+) level on callus growth was additionally found. Somatic embryos were formed 
      regardless of the level of N supplied. Changes to other media components, i.e., 
      macroelements other than N, microelements, vitamins, growth regulators, and sucrose 
      had no effect on callus growth and carotenoid accumulation. The results obtained 
      from this model system expand the range of factors, such as N availability, 
      composition of N salts, and ratio of nitrate to ammonium N form, that may affect the 
      regulation of carotenoid metabolism.

TI  - Changing Temperature Conditions during Somatic Embryo Maturation Result in Pinus 
      pinaster Plants with Altered Response to Heat Stress.
LID - 1318 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23031318 [doi]
AB  - Under the global warming scenario, obtaining plant material with improved tolerance 
      to abiotic stresses is a challenge for afforestation programs. In this work, 
      maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Aiton) plants were produced from somatic embryos 
      matured at different temperatures (18, 23, or 28 °C, named after M18, M23, and M28, 
      respectively) and after 2 years in the greenhouse a heat stress treatment (45 °C for 
      3 h/day for 10 days) was applied. Temperature variation during embryo development 
      resulted in altered phenotypes (leaf histology, proline content, photosynthetic 
      rates, and hormone profile) before and after stress. The thickness of chlorenchyma 
      was initially larger in M28 plants, but was significantly reduced after heat stress, 
      while increased in M18 plants. Irrespective of their origin, when these plants were 
      subjected to a heat treatment, relative water content (RWC) and photosynthetic 
      carbon assimilation rates were not significantly affected, although M18 plants 
      increased net photosynthesis rate after 10 days recovery (tR). M18 plants showed 
      proline contents that increased dramatically (2.4-fold) when subjected to heat 
      stress, while proline contents remained unaffected in M23 and M28 plants. Heat 
      stress significantly increased abscisic acid (ABA) content in the needles of 
      maritime pine plants (1.4-, 3.6- and 1.9-fold in M18, M23, and M28 plants, 
      respectively), while indole-3-acetic acid content only increased in needles from M23 
      plants. After the heat treatment, the total cytokinin contents of needles decreased 
      significantly, particularly in M18 and M28 plants, although levels of active forms 
      (cytokinin bases) did not change in M18 plants. In conclusion, our results suggest 
      that maturation of maritime pine somatic embryos at lower temperature resulted in 
      plants with better performance when subjected to subsequent high temperature stress, 
      as demonstrated by faster and higher proline increase, lower increases in ABA 
      levels, no reduction in active cytokinin, and a better net photosynthesis rate 
      recovery.

AB  - Wild Solanum species are the important resources for potato improvement. With the 
      availability of potato genome and sequencing progress, knowledge about genomic 
      resources is essential for novel genes discovery. Hence, the aim of this study was 
      to decipher draft genome sequences of unique potato genotypes i.e. somatic hybrid P8 
      (J1), wild species S. pinnatisectum (J2), progeny MSH/14-112 (P8 × cv. Kufri Jyoti) 
      (J3), and S. tuberosum dihaploid C-13 (J4). Draft genome sequencing using Illumina 
      platform and reference-based assemblies with the potato genome yielded genome 
      assembly size of 725.01 Mb (J1), 724.95 Mb (J2), 725.01 Mb (J3), and 809.59 Mb (J4). 
      Further, 39,260 (J1), 25,711 (J2), 39,730 (J3) and 30,241 (J4) genes were identified 
      and 17,411 genes were found common in the genotypes particularly late blight 
      resistance genes (R3a, RGA2, RGA3, R1B-16, Rpi-blb2, Rpi and Rpi-vnt1). Gene 
      ontology (GO) analysis showed that molecular function was predominant and signal 
      transduction was major KEGG pathways. Further, gene enrichment analysis revealed 
      dominance of metabolic process (GO: 0008152) in all the samples. Phylogeny analysis 
      showed relatedness with potato and other plant species. Heterozygous single 
      nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was more than homozygous, and SNP in genic region was 
      more than inter-genic region. Copy number variation (CNV) analysis indicated greater 
      number of deletions than duplications. Sequence diversity and conserved motifs 
      analysis revealed variation for late blight resistance genes. Quantitative real-time 
      polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis showed differential expression of late 
      blight resistance genes. Our study provides insights on genome sequence, structural 
      variation and late blight resistance genes in potato somatic hybrid (parents and 
      progeny) for future research.

AB  - Malaria is still a global health problem. Plasmodium is a single-cell protozoan 
      parasite that causes malaria and is transmitted to humans through the female 
      Anopheles mosquito. The previous study showed that Sonchus arvensis L. callus has 
      antiplasmodial activity. Several treatments are needed for callus quality 
      improvement for antimalarial compound production. This study aimed to examine the 
      effect of dolomite [CaMg(CO3)2] on growth (morpho-anatomical structure and biomass), 
      secondary metabolite production, and in vitro antiplasmodial activity of S. arvensis 
      L. callus. In this study, leaf explants were grown in Murashige and Skoog medium 
      with a combination of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D, one mg/L) and 6-benzyl 
      amino purine (BAP, 0.5 mg/L) with dolomite (50, 75, 100, 150, and 200 mg/L). The 21 
      days callus ethanolic and methanolic extract were analyzed by gas 
      chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and thin-layer chromatography (TLC). The 
      antiplasmodial test was performed on a blood culture infected with Plasmodium 
      falciparum strain 3D7 using the Rieckmann method. The results showed that dolomite 
      significantly affected callus growth, metabolite profile, and in vitro 
      antiplasmodial activity. Dolomite (150 mg/L) showed the highest biomass (0.590 ± 
      0.136 g fresh weight and 0.074 ± 0.008 g dry weight). GC-MS analysis detected four 
      compounds from callus ethanolic extract. Pelargonic acid, decanoic acid, and 
      hexadecanoic acid were major compounds. One new terpenoid compound is based on TLC 
      analysis. S. arvensis L. callus has antiplasmodial activity with the IC50 value of 
      5.037 μg/mL. It was three times lower than leaf methanolic extract and five times 
      lower than leaf ethanolic extract.

TI  - A Temporary Immersion System Improves Regeneration of In Vitro Irradiated 
      Recalcitrant Indica Rice (Oryza sativa L.) Embryogenic Calli.
LID - 375 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/plants11030375 [doi]
AB  - The development of gamma ray-mutated rice lines is a solution for introducing 
      genetic variability in indica rice varieties already being used by farmers. In vitro 
      gamma ray ((60)Co) mutagenesis reduces chimeras and allows for a faster selection of 
      desirable traits but requires the optimization of the laboratory procedure. The 
      objectives of the present work were sequencing of matK and rbcL, the in vitro 
      establishment of recalcitrant rice embryogenic calli, the determination of their 
      sensitivity to gamma radiation, and optimization of the generation procedure. All 
      sequenced genes matched perfectly with previously reported matK and rbcL O. sativa 
      genes. Embryogenic calli induction improved using MS medium containing 2 mg L(-1) 
      2,4-D, and regeneration was achieved with MS medium with 3 mg L(-1) BA and 0.5 mg 
      L(-1) NAA. The optimized radiation condition was 60 Gy, (LD20 = 64 Gy) with 83% 
      regeneration. An immersion system (RITA(®), Saint-Mathieu-de-Tréviers, France) of 
      either 60 or 120 s every 8 h allowed systematic and homogeneous total regeneration 
      of the recalcitrant line. Other well-known recalcitrant cultivars, CR1821 and 
      CR1113, also had improved regeneration in the immersion system. To our knowledge, 
      this is the first study reporting the use of an immersion system to allow for the 
      regeneration of gamma-ray mutants from recalcitrant indica rice materials.

TI  - Enhancing In Vitro Production of the Tree Fern Cyathea delgadii and Modifying 
      Secondary Metabolite Profiles by LED Lighting.
LID - 486 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/cells11030486 [doi]
AB  - The tree ferns are an important component of tropical forests. In view of this, the 
      enhancement of in vitro production of these plants is needed. Thus, the effect of 
      different light-emitting diodes (LEDs) as well as control fluorescent lamps (Fl) and 
      a 3-week-long period of darkness at the beginning of in vitro culture on 
      micropropagation of the tree fern Cyathea delgadii Sternb. was analysed. Moreover, 
      the photosynthetic pigment content and secondary metabolite profiles were estimated. 
      The period of darkness contributed to a high production of somatic embryo-derived 
      sporophytes and a low production of gametophytes. The formation of new sporophytes 
      was stimulated by RBY (35% red, 15% blue, and 50% yellow) and B (100% blue) lights 
      when the stipe explants or whole young sporophytes were used in the culture, 
      respectively. The elongation of the roots and leaves was stimulated by RBfR light 
      (35% red, 15% blue, and 50% far red), while root production increased under RBY 
      light. The RB (70% red and 30% blue) and B lights stimulated the accumulation of 
      chlorophyll better than Fl light. The most abundant metabolite found in the plant 
      extracts was trans-5-O-caffeoylquinic acid (1.013 µg/mg of dry weight). The extract 
      obtained from plants growing in a greenhouse had the best antioxidant activity.
